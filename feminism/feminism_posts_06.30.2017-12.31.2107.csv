Dirty seats and the smell of sweat and a hint of something rotten. The brakes squeal, there are lots of people packed into small spaces and you can never count on an uneventful ride.

But then again, sometimes the general discomfort is the best there is to hope for. Just when you are comfortable in the grind of taking public transportation, someone drags you back to the reality that comfort is not something you are allowed.

It's the comments, stares and on the bad days, violating touch. 

Today, a man stuck his hand in between my legs while pretending to sleep. Tomorrow, it might be a comment or uncomfortable gestures. 

The metro is supposed to be an accessible mode of travel for all. And yet, like nearly every other supposedly accessible place, it still remains a hostile place for women and those who do not fit within societal's top tiers of power. Like catcalling and all other forms of public harassment, it is one of the most embarrassing, terrifying and deeply humiliating experiences a person can have. 

But it's nearly normal. It's packaged into the everyday. With posters and hashtags and corporate pledges to do better but we still have a president who brags about sexually assaulting women. And that's just it, at the end of the day it makes perfect sense, too much sense, that women would experience harassment and assault at such high frequency yet little more than lip service is paid to the continued need for actual change to dismantle the culture that allows this. 

Just a quick example: To report it sexual harassment on the metro, you call a line, explain what happened, get put on hold and transferred and repeat and repeat and repeat until you are told to come in and file a report. The trauma of all that for some must be unbearable. Even after the fact it is seems almost an inconvenience.

With catcalling becoming normal at age 15, dress coding 14 year old girls, using words like slut, bitch and whore with regularity to mean the most vile of things, and most of all with powerful men like Trump, like Cosby, like Ailes splashed across headlines for sexual harassment and yet one of them is our president. Say no more.

We have to change this.

I have a story and question for anyone who can give me advice: 

So I am a lifeguard and We have a bunch of diving platforms at one of the stations ranging all the way from 3m to 10m. One night a bunch of young men were around the base of the towers and clearly one was being pressured into possible going off of the 10m. One of the men said, ""C'mon don't be such a girl!"" I was shocked and the man stammered back at me ""Oh no offence to you."" And at this point I'm pretty much thinking ""Do I say: 'So you just mean to be a girl is to be.. what?'"" and basically question why they think that is an appropriate thing to say. 

But I am a representative of my company when I'm in the workplace and I don't think I'm allowed to ""confront"" patrons, so I didn't say anything more. 

So here's my question: If I find myself in a similar situation, does anyone have any advice on how to handle it?

I'm posting this here to get as many responses as possible and while this question centres around feminism, I understand that not all women identify as such and I want to hear their responses as well. 

So, Jay-Z's latest album 4:44 came out last week and ever since I've been reading thinkpieces and forum comments chastising Beyonce for forgiving him and how it isn't very feminist of her. Here are the statements I'd like us to discuss that stuck out to me in particular:

- Beyonce should have her feminist card revoked because she took him back (allegedly, repeatedly)

- Beyonce is very male identified which is hurtful to women, feminism and her message

- ""A feminist story of betrayal would typically see a woman graciously, if crushed, walk away from a man who mistreats and cheats on her. A feminist message would encourage women not to choose ""emotionless"" partners who ""often womanize"" or need their ""child to be born....to see through a woman's eyes"", all confessions of Jay-Z's""

So here are specific questions I have regarding those statements:

1. Does feminism mean that we don't forgive in our relationships? Aren't relationships (marriage in this case) marathons between two imperfect people that strive to stay committed? Why do the decisions we make in our relationships affect our feminist status?

2. Again, to be a feminist does it mean that we don't love our men greatly and express it? Beyonce has made many a song describing her deep love and adoration of Jay-Z. What's wrong with expressing it? Sometimes it feels like feminism wants us to be like ""fuck men"" and not ""overly"" praise our partners. Why? Is this realistic?

For the women who don't identify as feminists, what do you think of these statements? Do you think Beyonce forgiving Jay-Z dilutes her woman empowerment message?

Also, just for context here are the lyrics to Jay-Z's specific song that addresses his cheating, etc:

*************************************
[Kim Burrell:]
Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down everyday
Letting you down everyday
Why do I keep on running away?

[Jay-Z:]
Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born
See through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song
I don't deserve you, I harass you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome""
You make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
""Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone""
Said: ""Don't embarrass me,"" instead of ""Be mine""
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday, you mature faster than me
I wasn't ready, so I apologize
I've seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death, I apologize for all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the woman whom I
Toyed with you emotions because I was emotionless
I apologize 'cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time you wasted in on all this basic shit
So I apologize

[Hannah Williams:]
I'm never gonna treat you
Never gonna treat you like I should

[Jay-Z:]
I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We're supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our hearts stops
And then we in a space where the dark stops
And lets love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over
What if?
You over
My shit?

[Hannah Williams:]
I'm never gonna treat you
Never gonna treat you like I should

[Jay-Z:]
And if my children knew, I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I had to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay

[Hannah Williams:]
I'm never gonna treat you like I should

CRA perpetuates this through Income Tax Act Section 122.6(f) ""(f) where the qualified dependent resides with the dependent's female parent, the parent who primarily fulfils the responsibility for the care and upbringing of the qualified dependent is presumed to be the female parent,"" (http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-3.3/). This does not always even mean the child's biological mother, in fact CRA has a repeated policy of revoking benefits to fathers who are claiming benefits, and handing them off to their spouse presuming she is basically nothing more than a house wife; this is also done without notice to or consent of the father; even in instance where custody is decided by previous court orders. 

  

  

What this means is that the CRA thinks of fathers as not being the caregivers, the lovers, the protectors and providers of their children; and at the same time CRA thinks of mothers as belonging in the home, of being less than equal to men when it comes to providing financially for their children. What this means is a woman who is a parent either step or biological is immediately presumed to be a housewife, and a father immediately presumed to be a deadbeat.  

  

  

What's worrisome about CRA's policies not just in their presumptions that women haven't gotten out of the kitchen, is that they actively fight fathers who claim their children; they deny and actively fight against valuable funding to men who are taking care of their children preventing a full and active participation in the child's life, and where this is disputed they deny both parents benefits. This hurts the most vulnerable of society, the children. The children are missing out, when parents can't get the appropriate tax deductions and credits, the parents can't give their children a quality of life that they deserve. 

  

How does the act and CRA's policies address LGBTQ rights? Quite honestly it doesn't, CRA has no policy for two male parents, two female parents, for a split family, for transgender parents, CRA would like to bury their heads in the sand and pretend the world hasn't changed in the last 60-70 years... but it has, women are out of the kitchen, gays are out of the closet, and fathers are looking after their children. CRA and their policies need to adapt and address to new families.  

  

Now this is where it gets tough, CRA does have a way around fathers being able to claim their children for the associated benefits; a permission slip from the female parent, in a married couple, imagine yourself women, if you needed permission from your husband to say you're a parent. Imagine yourself, if you escaped an abusive ex, the courts haven't ruled on custody yet (anyone going through the system knows it can take years), needing to go over and beg for a permission slip to say you're a parent. Imagine raising your child, providing them love, care, nutritious food, playing with them, giving them baths, making sure they're happy and healthy, only to have the government say you're not a parent, and that no matter what you provide it isn't good enough to prove it. This is what CRA is doing to the modern family.

Sorry for the title, I had trouble explaining myself. I'm quite tired of reading things like ""feminists nowadays are man-hating SJW"" or bullshit like that. You can always say ""the very vocal minority is just that, a minority"", or ""I hear more anti-feminist bullshit from anti-feminists than man-hating speeches from supposed feminists"", etc. but it's never a very interesting conversation. We all know that this man-hating SJW thing isn't new, when the first feminists starting campaigning for women's rights they were already called the same thing, in more context appropriate terms. Is there any articles out there who explain it, with examples ? I'd like to keep a few in my favorite bar so I can link them if needed. Plus it'd be an interesting read.

I'm trying to analyze this strictly from an economics point of view, not from a social or opinionated standpoint.

I see two scenarios:

A:  Males earn X (total economic payout) money, factories produce Y amount of product, female average free time = Z.  Product production satisfies consumer population, livable conditions.

B: Males earn X/2 money, females earn X/2 money, factory now produces Y+ amount of product from added female population, average female free time = Z- working hours.  Product production grows, prices drop across the board as demand decreases, single males and females have reduced buying power due to salary reduction.

Now the question:  Is there some accurate way to measure the amount of free time that women have given up in relation to the percentage price drop in consumer goods and reduction of male salaries?  How does this affect single earners in our economy, and their ability to survive?  Does it force more people to enter the workforce than in the past?

Just trying to understand the effects, not cause an argument.  Thanks.",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,Honest Question,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/6lu68x/honest_question/

All of the movies listed are what I have watched.

- A Good Deed - An unstable escaped convict terrorizes a woman who is alone with her two children.


Why is she strong? She's smart (makes good decisions), a quick thinker, not your stereotypical black woman, capable of doing things on her own, and will fight back. She is so far my favorite female protagonist. She's awesome.


Genre - Thriller


- Uncharted 4 - Eh. I only played part 1. Finished it, but didn't enjoy it. Didn't like the story, so I can't say much, if anything, about this at all. I just read about the protagonist, which is a spoiler, so I won't say. Also, no, I'm not... I'm not bad at all... Not. At. All. At shooting games. Nope. &gt;_&gt;


Genre - RPG shooter


- Frankie and Alice - A drama centered on a go-go dancer with multiple personality disorder who struggles to remain her true self and begins working with a psychotherapist to uncover the mystery of the inner ghosts that haunt her.


I've only seen this once and it was awhile ago. There was just one part I didn't like. I'm not sure if it had any importance to one of her characters or not. She uses the f-word, the gay slur. Other than that, she's a good portrayal of a strong black female lead, imo.


Why? My memory does me no justice sometimes. I just remembered thinking she was a strong black female protagonist and there were 2 reasons at least. I can't remember what they were. Ugh!


- The Help - An aspiring author during the civil rights movement of the 1960s decides to write a book detailing the African American maids' point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis.


Pretty much the summary said what I wanted to say. It talks about racism and abuse. There is one scene that not everyone is okay with and some saw it as racist. I thought it was a bit much, but I didn't like her any less. I mean she went through a lot of... crap. Ahem! Anyway, I just thought it was gross. SPOILER! If you're wondering what it is, then Minnie, the black woman, feeds Hilly (I think) a pie... that she made with her poop.


- Colombiana - A young woman, after witnessing her parents' murder as a child in Bogota, grows up to be a stone-cold assassin.


Why is she strong? She can fight battles on her own. I know just this doesn't always necessarily make a strong character, but she's shone to be smart through some battles and more.


Honorable Mention:


- A Normal Lost Phone - a game where you, the player, are the protagonist going through someone's phone. Sounds boring and pointless right?


Not the protagonist (why it's listed in honorable mentions), but a main/the most important(?) character in the game. I can't say much without giving spoilers away. It's also lgbtq+ pro. (If you don't have the game and can't afford it, I'd recommend watching Jacksepticeye play it. I looked for other YouTubers who played it, but he's the farthest into it and he got to the most important part.

So, I'm a male, 20 years old and I live in the UK for context. I often go out to nightclubs and in my area there are many students and the clubs are usually about 60% females. I see guys getting kicked out for harassing girls and feeling them up a bit while drunk, however, I often get girls coming up to me and grabbing my ass, kissing me, launching themselves at me and just saying vulgar dirty things to me while drunk. Personally I don't really mind I just think it's funny and everyone is having a good time but I've seen men go to complain about this behaviour and be laughed at by the security and the girls who were doing this to him. As I said I don't personally mind as I find it funny and all in good fun but I can see why some people would mind this and I can see why people get kicked out for doing the same things to girls.",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,Opinions on my personal experience of how bouncers/security handle males/females in clubs?

My little brother is fourteen and, like most kids his age, spends a lot of time on the internet. I don't know exactly what websites he visits, but I know that he spends a lot of time on his Xbox playing Overwatch and Destiny. He watches Youtubers like PewDiePie, Jacksepticeye, and Markiplier. He also messages and shares videos with his friends. Over the last few months I've noticed some issues arising with him that relate to women. 

He showed me a joke song with an animated video that contained a lot of rape jokes, and when I told him I didn't find it funny he got angry and stormed off. He brought up a video or movie (I don't remember exactly what it was) in which a woman was so badly raped that she needed a new anus. I was shocked because he said it like it was funny in front of his mother and his sister. When I told him that it was a horrible thing to say he acted confused as to why I was offended and made it clear that he was annoyed. He also complained to me about “crazy feminists who hate men” and mentioned a picture he'd seen of a girl drinking from a mug that said “Boys' Tears” on it. I tried explaining to him that while that sort of thing wasn't okay, it doesn't affect people's lives in the same way that misogyny does, and feminists aren't crazy. He basically shut down and stopped talking. More recently, my mother told me that he was complaining about feminists to her.

I've tried in the past to explain social issues to him, when I thought he was at the right age,  without shoving it down his throat. He was quick to understand homophobia and racism, but sexism is proving to be a bit of an issue. I've always had the expectation that as people matured and got more information they would become more aware of women's issues. When I was younger my views, naturally enough, were not as informed or open-minded as they are now. With him it seems to be the exact opposite, and I'm certain that it's because of online culture. I don't think him saying “ugh feminists are annoying” is a crisis to panic over, but I am worried about these things spiraling, especially since he is going to continue to be exposed to the same or worse material online. I do see a really slippery slope with this issue. Casual sexism between friends could spill over to comment sections or eventually some of the weirder subreddits where it can gain traction, intensify and make its way back into real life.

I don't know how to approach the issue with him. I'm not trying to brainwash him and I don't want to nag him, but mentioning it at all seems to really get his back up. I have no desire to try to ban him from anything. I know he's going to encounter a lot of online misogyny, just like I do, and I want him to be able to see it for what it is. There is no value in taking a “boys will be boys” approach, and I know that all teenagers make mistakes, but I don't think waiting it out is the right thing to do. I was hoping for some advice on how to handle this and what to say to him. He's a really sweet kid and I know he can come around.",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,Younger brother and sexism online: need advice.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/6n6jtn/younger_brother_and_sexism_online_need_advice/

I am part of a creative team of female identifying artists that make new opera. We seek to use our artistic resources to tell stories--unwitnessed and undocumented-- through music theatre. Our performances attempt to reclaim and reshape the female narratives that dominate traditional opera. To that end, our current piece ‘Unseal Unseam’ is an electro-acoustic opera that examines the too-often invisible world of domestic violence, and hopes to provide a place for healing and solidarity. 
We want to ground the work in the lived truths of our community, so we have created a series of abstracted, creative prompts through which people may share their relationship to the phenomena of domestic violence. We have compiled the prompts in this google form:

https://goo.gl/forms/cDlqMRovuPHXCI4J2

I am sharing this here to see if any of you feel moved to participate in this reflection. We want to emphasize that the form is completely anonymous, and no one should feel pressure to share events, stories, or experiences that they don't feel comfortable reflecting on. Participants should feel free to fill in as much or as little as they'd like.

Cis man here. I've been in a heterosexual relationship for 4 years now. Both of us consider oursleves feminists and have put a lot of effort into challenging existing problematic behaviours within ourselves with a rather good success rate. 
However recently we had a conversation in which she pointed out that I've been acting in a sexist manner for some time in terms of mansplaining, disregard of her opinions etc. Which is unfortunately true but I wasn't seeing it. So I came to the conclusion I've become complacent with my feminism - like I've 'completed' it when it actually is a neverending process which has lead to reverting or even exibiting new problematic behaviour. 

I don't want to become one of those partners you read about - _""I thought he was a feminist but he turned out to be a total shitbag""_ etc. and I think complacency can lead to just that. I can't be advising my male friends on feminism and calling out behaviours that I can't even see I'm doing in my own relationship. 

So I'd like some advice from experience or some reading material on the topic. And the more specifically it addresses the issue of complacency, the better. I feel anything broader at the moment won't really help me much.

He is a white cis male from an upper middle class family. I've never been with someone who fit that description before him, and I had no idea how exhausting it is, even when he really wants to be an ally.

He was raised by a 2nd wave feminist and has all sisters, so he feels like he 'gets it', and on big picture issues he generally does. 

The problem is with issues that he actually deals with in daily life. I'm starting to realize that maybe his upbringing (not due to the mom's feminism, but some other dynamics in his home that I know about) caused him to internalize an idea that men are inherently bad, and so even when he wants to be on the right side of an issue, he becomes defensive because he feels personally attacked. The ego is fragile in this one. I often just want to throw in the towel, but I know he's not a faux feminist, just trying to win points, so I also feel like there's some value in being patient and helping him get there.

Some of the things that drive me crazy:

He's a #notallmen. Way before the hashtag, we got into some almost relationship-ending fights because if i said something about men, he'd say that if I say ""men do x"", that i""m saying he does it (and of course, he doesn't, no need for introspection, right?) He still hates the hashtag and doesn't get the irony of his stance on this.

He does on some level think that women exist for his pleasure. He doesn't think this is true because he is passive towards women. He thinks it's feminist of him to tell me that I shouldn't wear make up or that women shouldn't style their hair etc. He thinks that liking ""natural"" women makes him superior. I'll ask him, ""What does that woman's make up or shaved head or piercings have to do with you, or with being attractive to you or anyone else?"" 

He feels ""left out"" and doesn't understand why women, or POC, etc, don't always invite people like him into the conversation when he wants to be an ally. He has that whole ""why am I the enemy when at least I'm trying, it's not like I'm a white supremacist wife beater, why not attack them instead"" attitude. Again, I suggest ""It's not about you.""

The other day he admitted that when his coworker explained that he shouldn't be calling the female students bossy, he admitted to having a knee jerk reaction to it. In this case he was able to calmly hear me out, but he didn't totally get it.

He also once even actually said out loud the whole ""I'm not a slave owner"" thing in relation to difficulty in accepting his white privilege. I wanted to actually face palm. (I'm also white, and I have zero issues fully admitting the unearned privilege that it has afforded me. With him, I can see that even though he wants to embrace the idea, he can't separate admitting that privilege from injuring his sense of self).

He also calls me a class warrior, and says that ""everyone suffers. If someone loses their mother, it doesn't matter if they are rich, etc."" Um, yes it does if one person has to halt their grieving process to fight an eviction, etc. 

He only says these things in close company because he gets that they aren't going to be taken well, but he doesn't understand why. From knowing him for this amount of time, I believe he is genuine, not the type of fake feminist that SNL skewered so well. But I want to rip my hair out more and more. We've gotten to the point where we avoid these topics in order to keep the peace.

Links to websites showing disturbing images/video have asterisks “**.”

One positive movement that has gained ground in recent years has been the growing effort to expose and challenge the existence of rape culture. From Trump’s “locker room talk” to Steubenville High School, from the Stanford rape trial last year to the rape epidemic in the US military, those who have spoken out have forced the rest of us to address the pervasive lack of respect for sexual consent. In order to deal with rape culture it is critical to identify and address the manifestations of this problem, despite the disturbing nature of the subject matter. 

Many types of pornography contribute to rape culture in various ways but some are particularly harmful. One recent trend in internet pornography is the stripped-down, raw filming of abuse, humiliation, and forced sex acts. This is not simulated ""rape fantasy"" pornography, which dramatizes realistic situations of rape. The theme of this “abuse porn” is violent degradation — men use their penises, words and other tools to attempt to break down and strip all dignity from a woman who they are choking and otherwise sexually attacking with real force.

Some sites add intense racist humiliation by intentionally using numerous insults and props to trigger further degradation. The theme of the “Ghetto Gaggers” films, for example, is white men humiliating and sexually dominating Black women - physical violence coupled with jokes about poverty, welfare, slavery, putting nooses on women, etc. While a [few writers] (http://livingcivil.com/the-racist-side-of-the-nations-largest-industry-ghetto-gaggers/) and [activists] (http://www.antipornography.org/extreme_humiliation_abusive_porn_info.html), a [documentary film] (http://www.hotgirlswantedmovie.com/), and now a [Lifetime movie] (http://www.mylifetime.com/movies/from-straight-as-to-xxx) have shed light on sites like Ghetto Gaggers, Latina Abuse (now called Latina Throats), Black on Black Crime and Facial Abuse (now called Facef**king), it has become a growing cultural atrocity that most media sources refuse to acknowledge. The story has been mainly to have been left to a handful of [courageous vloggers] (https://youtu.be/P7X9xWP0qjc?t=3m24s) and others who refuse to be silent.

In making claims about this highly sensitive issue, I do not intend to speak for the women involved or from an experience common to theirs. I am a man who has no experience as a sex worker or with the kind of intense sexual violence these women endure. I am speaking out to insist that rape is rape, whether people are doing it in private or selling filmed violence for profit. There is a difference between simulated, dramatized rape fantasies - where the participants are safe and consent is respected - and real forced sex. Out of the greed and desperation created by the commodification of labor, people are selling their sexual consent and dignity in the most prosperous nation in the world. The perpetrators make a product of this utter degradation, reinforcing and profiting from the racist, misogynist desires of anonymous online consumers. 

In addition to the effects these acts of violence have on the women being attacked, the propagation of this kind of porn normalizes rape culture every day. What can we expect from [young boys] (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1255856/Teenage-boys-watching-hours-internet-pornography-week-treating-girlfriends-like-sex-objects.html) raised masturbating to men raping and humiliating women? Men have every reason to stand up with women and gender non-conforming people and insist that sexual violence is not just another product to be consumed. Rape culture degrades us all. Finally, I speak as a witness to the latest act in a tragedy that has been playing out for centuries. The oppression enacted in these films is carrying on legacies of hate that have been protected by the silent complicity of most men and white folks for far too long. Silence is an invisible glass wall that preserves atrocities in plain sight.

Rape is Rape

Some commenters defend abuse porn on the grounds that it is rough but consensual adult sex. Supposedly, the performer freely chooses to participate beforehand, signs a contract, and can theoretically stop the shoot - thus there are no ethical issues here. There are at least 4 ways to demonstrate that this is a dangerous myth and that these films routinely violate the sexual consent of the women performers.

First, many of these films show actual, indisputable sexual assault regardless of any consent given beforehand. These videos that are being sold for profit routinely show women being held down and choked by penises while they are “tapping” repeatedly to breathe and actively fighting the male performer off who continues to choke and slap and penetrate the woman. Consent is given moment to moment and the perpetrators in these films continue the violence after the withdrawal of consent is clearly communicated. Forcing sex acts on someone who is fighting back or expressing any lack of consent is rape regardless of any prior agreement.

Some defenders of this type of porn may point to the fact that some of the women are filmed after their abuse to show that they are okay and that they willingly agreed to everything in the film. It seems clear that the perpetrators would not give these women their full payment if they reported that they were violently forced during the filming as it appears. The exit interviews are produced by the perpetrators and cannot be trusted. Anyone who is able to endure the brutality shown in the film can be expected to say whatever is demanded about their experience afterwards in order to fulfill the contract and go home.

A few survivors of abuse porn films have spoken out to give their genuine reflections on what happened. This is from a courageous blog post by a woman describing [her experience] (http://clayrabeau.blogspot.com/2010/12/hard-city-indeed.html) on in a Facial Abuse shoot: “I was still on my knees an the guys were so aggressive that at one point I literally had to stand up and push with all of my strength to get off of him. there is no point in having a safe word when you can’t talk. I was clawing at their legs and slapping their thighs and they still wouldn’t let up.”

[One mother] (http://www.antipornography.org/harm_stories.html#170112) from New York City who agreed to do a scene for Latina Abuse to support her children has given her testimony: “I was a victim of this website. They tell you that they won’t abuse you. They start very nice, taking their time. They said, 'You’re just going to do a little porn, get paid and get out.' No, that’s not the truth. I didn’t know it was in a warehouse. The lady didn’t tell me where I was going. And once I got there and begged them to stop, and told them I wanted to leave, they just beat me up more.”

This woman reports that she is now taking psychotropic medication and feels she was traumatized for life from the experience. She reported privately that she agreed to be in this film by responding to a Craigslist ad for a porn film that gave no warning of the violence she was about to face.

One member of the Ghetto Doorway websites said this about the videos [he has paid to see] (http://www.antipornography.org/facial-abuse-com-truth-of-real-abuse-exploitation.html): “I like things a little rough sometimes, but watch the “******” video, for example, and it’s pretty clear these guys are rapists. At first she was game, but she ends up crying and shaking uncontrollably. The camera keeps rolling while these scumbags make it clear that “no” is not an acceptable answer. Disgusting. Yeah, some of the facial photos look appealing, but this site crosses the line from fantasy to flat out rape.”

The “Ghetto Doorway” perpetrators are proud of a particular rape technique that these men seem to have invented, which they jokingly named after a wrestling move. In the “figure whore leg lock,” the man wraps his legs around the neck and head of the victim and forces the woman’s head on his penis, leaving her incapable of speaking or breathing. Fluids, including vomit, generally shoot out the mouth and nostrils of the victim. The woman usually very quickly taps the man urgently for air and tries to pull away and a (rape) struggle ensues as the man uses force to keep gagging and suffocating them with his penis. For those who need to see this to believe it, try watching [this video**] (http://www.inflexwetrust.com/2013/03/29/video-warning-18-only-this-is-wild-harlem-shake-struggles-girls-suffocating-on-the-what/) that circulated on the internet several years ago, apparently generating little public commentary. This particular video compilation is intended to be humorous, making a joke out of the fight between a rapist and their victim. To put this content in perspective, this is not just a few isolated acts of abuse hidden away in a far corner of the internet; the site where [this same video**] (http://efukt.com/21056_The_Harlem_Struggle.html) (now removed) was mainly viewed shows over 5 million views. Millions of men have watched those perpetrators sexually assault those women in the context of a “funny” video. Clearly, rape culture is the norm for many men in 21st century USA.

Second, some abuse porn films show men perpetrating what is known as “incapacitated rape.” One of the most disturbing videos I came across showed a white man behind a Black woman holding his arm around her neck so tightly that she did actually black out for about 10–20 seconds, during which time the man roughly pulled her limp body around, slapped her in the face, and forced his penis into her mouth repeatedly — while she was [still blacked out**] (http://www.xnxx.com/video-5rvk6ea/he_made_this_bitch_black_out_) from being choked.

Another form of incapacitated rape shown in these films is against women who are being traumatized and who cannot give consent. Many researchers have concluded that many people who are being raped “freeze” in the “fight or flight” moment of intense fear and bodily danger. Traumatic responses to sexual assault are varied, yet most are exhibited by women in abuse porn films. Those who can handle watching several abuse porn videos will probably see women crying, trying to flee from the men on set, fighting back, dissociating (“going all retarded,” in the words of the perpetrators), freezing. Research suggests that 12%-50% of people being who are being raped go into this state of “tonic immobility,” and that people who have been traumatized earlier in life -- which is often the case with women in the sex industry -- are more likely to go into this state of paralysis. When in this state, people are [unable to speak or move] (http://nij.gov/multimedia/presenter/presenter-campbell/Pages/welcome.aspx). Human beings who are drugged, asleep, unconscious, and “frozen” in tonic immobility cannot give consent. Those who force sex on people in these states are committing sexual assault. This involuntary mammalian response has allowed perpetrators to use immobility as an excuse and opportunity — and police often believe the perpetrators because there was no obvious resistance.

The men who produce abuse porn often note the effects of the [trauma they are producing**:] (http://blackonblackcrimekitty.com/)

“…The financial burden of life finally caught up and forced her to sell that black ass. As the strange cock penetrated her, she just shut down. Her body was limp and her eyes were dead inside. She tried to go to her happy place but was brought back to reality as the cum dripped from her forehead.”

The film Hot Girls Wanted captures a candid moment showing some psychological effects induced by these forms of violent sex that deeply undermine consent. After returning from a “forced blowjob” scene, one young performer realizes she was having the emotions some rape victims have while she was being forced. She experienced terror and guilt and she wasn’t sure if she could say “no” once things got going despite how awful it became during her scene for that unnamed film series.

Third, many women who enter the sex industry are [coerced to do so] (http://harvardpress.typepad.com/hup_publicity/2013/08/catharine-mackinnon-on-lovelace.html) by husbands, boyfriends, agencies and pimps, as was the famous star of Deep Throat, Linda Lovelace.  The Japanese porn industry has recently been rocked by [a major scandal] (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3655941/Japans-porn-industry-apologises-coercion-claims.html) involving the coercion and manipulation of porn performers, revealing that seemingly legitimate, contractual porn can in fact be showing forced sex. The perpetrators of abuse porn are not afraid to engage in [this form of rape**] (http://www.defaceherface.com/category/black-on-black-crime/), or at least make it out to be that way.

“****** ***** is nothing more than a black skank from Philly whose pimp is making her do BlackOnBlackCrime. She’s a small hood rat and doesn’t have the body that’s able to take a good beating, but she got one anyway…”

Based on existing research on the porn industry and evidence from abuse porn websites, it is safe to conclude that some women in these films are experiencing this form of coercion. For the women being forced in this way, their participation and their signature on an already deceptive contract are empty gestures of consent.

Fourth, the desperation of poverty leaves many in our society, especially the young and very vulnerable, like many single mothers, facing life options that range from bad to worse. Many teenagers, even younger than those who are legally allowed to perform in porn films, trade sex in order to get food and other necessities. Some young people even get arrested intentionally in order to secure access to food. Other teens make porn in order to pay for college. Miriam Weeks a.k.a. Belle Knox, who has attracted a great deal of media attention for being both a Duke University student and an outspoken porn performer, did her first ever porn film with Facial Abuse. 

In the powerful 2015 documentary Hot Girls Wanted, one performer who was filmed by Latina Abuse seemed disgusted to see Knox on national news talking about how “empowered” she felt to be a porn performer. This experienced performer didn’t believe Knox’s PR-sounding lines about how much she loved doing porn, noting that Knox refused to even acknowledge being filmed in extremely abusive porn. The woman who had been in a Latina Abuse film stated bluntly that that kind of scene is something some people can’t “come back from” and that Knox was “one of the girls that didn’t know what she was getting herself into.” The recent Lifetime movie depicting Weeks’ experiences shows her being pressured by the director and terrified to be attacked on a fictionalized version of Facial Abuse. From Straight A’s to XXX did show some of the violence and degradation in these films but was relatively mild - showing some slapping and some degrading comments before fading out. The reality of these films is much more cruel and brutal than the film reveals.

Abuse porn sites are not shy about how they prey on the most naïve and inexperienced of porn performers. The texts on Ghetto Gaggers and other websites describe how they trick eighteen-year-olds and other young women who mostly have never have been in a porn film and clearly have been manipulated in some way and totally unprepared for what they are about to face. We know that poor teens are [selling sex for food] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/some-poor-us-teens-are-so-desperate-food-theyre-trading-sex-for-it_us_57d722c5e4b0aa4b722c0f40?section=&amp;) and at least one Facial Abuse participant used her porn earnings to pay for her college tuition. The websites actually joke about how some of these women are being violated because they are desperate to pay for food and other necessities for their children. It’s more than likely that many women have engaged in the sexual torture so that they and their children can simply survive. It would be surprising if many of the women in these films were not homeless or in precarious living situations to resort to such brutality to earn money. What kind of consent can someone fighting hunger and homelessness give to a lying, threatening producer on a contract that doesn’t describe the reality of the abuse they are about to suffer?

Conclusion

With or without the intense racial humiliation being perpetrated in some abuse porn, the violation of sexual autonomy and consent is actually a core element in this whole genre. Many abuse porn scenes show acts of rape regardless of whether they are committed against wealthy white performers or hungry, racially oppressed women who are doing porn to support their loved ones. There are very few more distilled embodiments of rape culture than this commodified footage of sexual assault. Anyone with open internet access can see women being assaulted while they are blacked out, forced on a penis while they are tapping for air, and other acts of forced sex. The fear of sounding moralistic or prudish often prevents sex-positive people from criticizing porn.  For this and other reasons, many conversations about rape culture do not address the influence of porn and are thus deeply lacking. Further, in studying about our reactions to extreme stress and trauma, scientists have discovered what some have long known, that humans and other mammals often “freeze” or are often completely immobile during the traumatic event. This has massive implications for any extreme pornography that puts the performer under such stress that they can no longer give or deny consent. There is evidence, both visual and textual from abuse porn sites that some of those on film become unable to respond in any way during the scene.

In a profit-based industry that employs people who need money to use as sexual objects, it follows that the most ruthless porn producers will find the most desperate, addicted, traumatized, or inexperienced youths to violate. The discussion on rape culture must also address the structural exploitation and impoverishment involved in the privatized labor market. A society that allows human trafficking and forced servitude to persist through exchanging money for people has reached its logical conclusion in the realm of legal pornography - human beings are selling their ability to consent to sex. It only takes viewing a few films to see that once the woman is on camera, the men deny her right to resist the abuse or assert any agency without “tapping out” and losing all but a couple hundred dollars for their suffering. Once the filming starts, videos of the woman will definitely be sold and promoted online, whether or not she goes through with the violence or takes a couple hundred dollars to quit, forcing a twisted incentive to stay and just try to get through the assault once it begins. This is nowhere near genuine consent. The violence of dispossession under the market system that exploits most of us has led to the commodification of our right to say “no.” It seems the power of money over human beings has left our cultural commons vulnerable to the degradation created when the most cruel can pay to violate the most desperate among us for entertainment.  

The perpetrators of abuse porn are still assaulting women and marketing the evidence online. Women who were filmed on these sites over a decade ago are still having these films of them sold and shared on the internet. It would be easy to shut down the producers of abuse porn films and seek accountability if they were exposed publicly, but this requires more people willing to break the silence and say or do something to fight back. 

What is it called when sociopathic men with money lie and prey on desperate youths, who endure racist degradation and sexual assault in order to survive?

Something I really want for myself is marriage(or some type of union) and kids. But... I'm becoming so disheartened.

In no way is this a troll, or an attempt to make fun of or discredit the ideology of feminism.


As a 23 year old white male, I have no real clean and concise knowledge of what the ideals of true feminism are. From what I have read and seen, it seems rather diluted. Many definitions, many different opinions ect. Which I guess comes with any belief or ideology that is undertaken by a large enough group of people. 

My personal belief is that while gender inequality is an issue atleast in some parts of our society, I don't see it being nearly as present as it is portrayed to be. Along with common pieces of evidence presented by people trying to prove its presence everywhere, being misrepresented and misunderstood. For example the pay gap. 

So my question is, What is feminism, and what is it trying to achieve?

Why it's an issue? It's tied to racism, especially internalized racism, as black men see black women less attractive or ""girlfriend material"", which affects their self esteem and sense of self value. It also reduces their representativity, as most famous black men here dates white women. Also increases the chances of single motherhood, in which the mother usually has much more duties and responsabilities than the father and help to keep them in poverty.

Doing a lot of reseach but all help is welcome, tahnk you in advance!!

These are the topic i wish to develop:

The concepts of sex / gender / sexual difference.

The construction of the sexual difference and the binomial man - woman from the heteronormative organization of sexualities.
Non-binary sexual identities: the concepts of intersex, travesti, transgender, transsexual, 3rd genus. 

Problematization of the sex / gender distinction, in which ""sex"" would be the biological difference of bodies and ""gender"" the set of representations and social roles associated with the former. The ""gender"" as a social construction (Simone de Beauvoir: ""one is not born a woman, one becomes a woman""). 

Is it possible to perceive ""sex"" (the biological dimension) without the dimension of cultural construction? (Judith Butler, excerpt from ""Bodies that Matter"")

The gender ""norms"" built in society: femininities and masculinities. Catalogs of Christmas toys of the hypermarket. The structure clearly sexed and binary - toys for ""boys"", toys for ""girls""; Color and shape codes; Toys and ""formatting"" in the sense of certain roles, functions and social places, that is, the dominant social construction of femininities (possibilities of being ""woman"") and masculinities (possibilities of being ""man"").

The ""biological essentialism"" of sex versus gender as a social construction. The concept of ""building"". ""Masculine"" vs. ""Masculinities""; ""Feminine"" vs. ""Feminities"". The bodies as signs - the impossibility of perception of bodies without all the set of meanings associated with them and that is formed and evolves historically in the culture.

I am trying to educate myself about feminism and I find I learn best when I can listen to someone speak and ideally see them interact.  For this reason I was wondering if my fellow redditors had links or suggestions for me to follow to online talks/discussions they think are of worth.

Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time.

  The reason that race comes up so often in my thoughts on gender is because America seems to have a pretty clear view of how to address the historical progression of African Americans within the US.  We had a war over race.  #Blacklives matter has become a 21st century battlecry of the civil rights movement.  It just seems like race has always been in the forefront of our national conversation, while gender remains been a second tier topic at best.  I am functioning on the idea that racial and gender minorities are both oppressed, both need to remain in our national conversation, and both have equal value.

Can a culture both value femininity and allows expression of traditionally masculine traits?  It seems as though women have to throw away their entire cultural identity in order to be viewed as equal to men, while other minorities are told to celebrate their distinctiveness.   African Americans celebrate their cultural heritage while women who are homemakers, wear dresses, and engage in other activities associated with femininity are viewed as enforcing negative stereotypes. Are these both examples of forward thinking action? Do they both enforce negative stereotypes?

Is it a fallacy to view race and gender through the same lens?

Although I will be spending most of my time dealing with these issues, I'd like to have a better understanding of the issues many of my team are working on. 

I know this isn't a subreddit for all diversity issues, but I know intersectional feminism kind of touches on these areas. Would anyone be able to point me in the direction of some good books in these areas or even better if there are any on the area as a whole?

i told this to my friend, whose advice was for me to change my user handle to be more gender neutral and to not let anyone know im a girl, because that somehow yields more useful responses on anything. 

does anyone else have similar experiences? or experiences that are completely different? explanations other than ""a gender thing""? i'm genuinely curious; i honestly hadnt really thought of subreddits other than obvious MRA ones as being ""male dominated"" so i'm just wondering what people here at r/feminism think of this ... also would anyone else say that ""reddit culture"" is a thing at all? lmk your thoughts",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,reddit culture and women - your experiences?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/6qu1hr/reddit_culture_and_women_your_experiences/

I am a 20 year old male from Australia. For the past few months I have been contemplating doing volunteer work in the Middle East for social issues I am interested in. I have a strong interest in helping women who are oppressed in the Middle East or Western/Central Asia. I am deeply interested in giving any service I can to women in the countries of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan or possibly Iraq. I find treatment of women in these locations wholly barbaric and I want to help them as much as possible.

I know some of the countries listed are not entirely safe and stable, so I politely request that is taken into account.

The reason I post this in here is because I was looking for someone to share or help me find an organisation that I can volunteer with in these countries.

The only qualifications I have are my tertiary studies in international business.

In Linda Nochlin's seminal essay [""Why have there been no great women artists""](http://deyoung.famsf.org/files/whynogreatwomenartists_4.pdf) (1971) she explains that feminists have tried to answer this question by digging up/uncovering/discovering women artists, and holding them up as examples to show that there are indeed great women artists. Nochlin critiques this approach because it doesn't address the institutional issues that have allowed for men to be primarily represented or have disallowed women from obtaining education as professional artists. 

She goes on to say other feminists have tried to suggest that there is a different kind of greatness that women have than man, and therefore they belong in their own separate canon (which also fails to challenge the traditional art canon for its privileging of the male artist). 

However, Nochlin does not give examples of these two groups of feminists who are falling short (beyond one article by Ernst Guhl about ""Women Artists"", a book by Peter S. Walch on Angelica Kauffman and another book by R. Ward Bissell on Artemesia Gentilieschi). Anyone have any examples of who she may be referring to as the feminists writing around the 1960s, either inserting unknown women artists into the canon, or trying to ascribe to a woman artist a distinct feminine greatness?

I feel ashamed. I saw a video of myself next to this 20 year old who's in wicked good shape and there I am with my stomach hanging out, I can't stand it, I used to be that stunning young woman. I identified with that, and now you can't even see my jaw bone because of the face fat. 

But I'm ashamed that I'm ashamed. I know weight doesn't equal health, that it's a socio-cultural construct (mostly) meant to suppress women. Keep us in constant anxiety because of our bodies and we can't focus on the oppressors - there's no energy to do so. I KNOW this. Just as I know that once I get better I'll have the strength to exercise again, to be in really good shape and eat well, that this shouldn't worry me as much as it does. 

And yet...I've always struggled with my self image. Not feeling good enough, that there were always so many things wrong with my body, even when I was *underweight*. I hate this. It's all so insidious, when even someone like me who is genuinely body positive, who *knows* fatphobia is a real and damaging phenomenon, can't accept that she's gained 30 pounds. And that's the really insane thing - that's not even that much! Some people weigh a lot more than me and are waaaay healthier, but nonetheless encounter so much prejudice I don't have to face because I still fit in ""straight"" sizes.

The hero did believe in some stereotypes to begin with, such as thinking the heroine to be a nurse. The heroine is actually a doctor and immediately corrected him; she is also a great character, willing to take a shot for another, and saved the hero twice. The brief romance between them is also smooth and not jarring at all.

Athena (Heidi Moneymaker) is a swole female mercenary that plays a lot in the actions part of the film. She is scary, skilled, and very capable of violence.

There is also a black mom, while sometimes her acting is funny, what she does is nothing funny at all. Fetching weapons to arm the protagonist's squad, beating the hell out of unsuspecting mercenaries - she probably does war better than the kid who thinks war is a game.

There is a rich kid who thinks war is a game. Through him, and overall brutality of war, the movie shows how wrong his thinking is. The movie may sound like a ""propaganda"" or ""nationalist"" movie, and is reported this way, but in a few scenes it actually points out the flaws and problems in Chinese bureaucracy.

Overall one of the most watched films recently in China. In the US, it achieved 190K in the first few days, due to the movie was only screened 53 times in those few days, and data shows theaters are cutting its screening for unknown reasons.

I have met many women who are athletically gifted, but don't do well academically. I feel like these women could excel in manual labor occupations, but their access to jobs like that is limited because of how our culture gives preference to men who are willing to fill those positions.

* All posts must be relevant to women's issues

    Please help us keep our discussion on-topic and relevant to women's issues. If your reaction to a post about how women have it bad is but insert group has it bad, too! Then its probably something that belongs in another subreddit

* All posts must come from an educated perspective

    All ideological considerations must demonstrate actual understanding of the relevant feminist concepts.
Comments consisting of exploratory/follow-up questions, in good faith, constitute an exception to these requirements (though we do encourage reading our definitions/studies sections of the FAQ).

* Promoting regressive agendas is not permitted

    The ""no platform"" rule: The validity of the various progressive pursuits (by women, children, LGBT, men, various ethnicities, people with disabilities, etc) is considered axiomatic. No blanket attacks are permitted against progressive movements, their egalitarian aspect, or the continued necessity of their existence.
In particular: all participants must observe progressive principles (this is not a value-free space). Equality of rights and respect for human dignity are considered axiomatic.

* Be respectful and courteous

    Feminism does not work in isolation, but rather is interconnected with all other work for justice and egalitarianism, and we believe that as injustice is addressed and overcome in society, all marginalized groups will benefit

* Respect the 'assume good faith' principle

    When editorializing or discussing, please respect the assume good faith principle - that actions or statements are done in good faith, absent actual evidence to the contrary; in particular, do not address claims that were not actually made (avoid derailing/addressing a strawman)

* **New rule: Derailing is prohibited**

    **If​ ​your​ ​reaction​ ​to​ ​a​ ​post​ ​about​ ​how​ ​women​ ​have​ ​it​ ​bad​ ​is​ ​""but​ ​[insert​ ​group]​ ​has​ ​it​ ​bad,​ ​too!"" then​ ​it's​ ​probably​ ​something​ ​that​ ​belongs​ ​in​ ​another​ ​subreddit.**

&amp;nbsp;

Any rule violation(s) may result in the comment(s) or post(s) being removed and a permanent ban placed on the user account(s).

I'm a college English instructor, but I'm still worried that, because I come from the rural south and regularly attend church, I may accidentally misrepresent women.

So, I'm wondering what the ideal feminist representation of a woman is in literature, specifically in a work that plans to ignore many of the pressing issues out there.  In other words, I don't believe I'll be writing a *The Awakening* or even *The Handmaid's Tale* or anything of that sort, at least not consciously.  

What I do plan to do is to write a series of books in which a girl/woman is the main character, one who is driven, capable, intelligent, relentless, adaptable, logical, and caring.  I have not yet decided how many other female characters there will be besides her.  I do know that she will be respected in the series and continually gain respect through her actions and ideologies and uncompromising drive to do what is right and is unwilling to sacrifice others to save herself or really under any circumstances.

I was a single father with custody and raising his daughter for a long time, and I just want to write a character that my daughters can be proud of and aspire to be and that my wife will be proud that I wrote.

The question actually came to me when I began reading *The Eumenides* by Aeschylus, and I realized in the introduction that Athena would eventually judge that Orestes' killing of his mother to avenge her murder of his father was more important than his mother's killing of his father to avenge the father sacrificing his/her daughter.  I began then wondering whether this essentially argued that the wants/needs/roles of women were being judged subservient to those of men, which got me to thinking about what exactly the proper definition of a woman is, whether the definition of either ""woman"" or ""man"" need take into account the definition of the other one, etc.

So, when written as the proper representation of what feminism wants her to be, what traits should an ideal woman in literature have?  What are her goals, desires, motivations?  What should she be be associated with?  I am definitely aware of the Bechdel test and plan to pass it intentionally, but I know there are many other concerns and ones that I'm not thinking of here.

Black vs white

Deserves respect.
Unless of course they are absolute asshats.

I agree there are problems in the world but we can move past them if we come together in equality and stop this us vs them dynamic in the world.

I believe BuzzFeed is one of the problems
Yesterday I saw an article about how male feminists can't be real feminists, and thats just pushing us vs them.

to get equality we need to all come together as humans not races genders or political beliefs.

There is a lot of sexism and racism in the world but it doesn't help being sexist or racist back.

Reverse racism is a thing and it's just racism.
Reverse sexism is a thing and it's just sexism.

Misgendering is insulting but sometimes people don't understand or haven't heard of your gender, it will help with the cause if we calmly explain what your gender is.

We can't just keep blaming and being sexist/racist back otherwise it make feminism seem like a man hating/whitehating thing when in fact feminism is an amazing cause fighting for equality.

I am much more inclined to believe it has to do with culture, and a good hard example against women being biologically inferior would be the country of Iran, where women make up the majority of engineers. Now granted, Iran has segregated schools between men and women, and they are under a theocracy, but if your basis was of biological merit, then this would be a good hard example to prove otherwise.

Now, I will say that culture, primarily American culture, plays a huge role. 

Let's think back to middle school tech-ed courses, and think of the demographic in play. White/Asian nerdy boys primarily, a few hispanic and black nerds, and once in a while a nerdy girl. 

This demographic holds true throughout high school. I would know, I was a guy who took tech ed courses in middle school/high school between two secondary schools, and this demographic holds true in hackathons, coding conventions, tech conventions, and..... tech jobs!

But why? Why do women, aside from a minority number, shy away from tech? Because of nerd culture. Yep, I'm just keeping it 100% honest here. Nobody likes nerds, besides other nerds. As someone who graduated from high school in 2015, the same stereotypes from 2-3 decades ago still hold true.

Nerds don't have friends to sit with at lunch, they are too autistic to make friends, and ESPECIALLY girlfriends, they are easy to pick on, and on the social hierarchy in high school they are at the very bottom.

So they fall back on tech, video games, and porn. And now you know why 90% of league players are males, just as the majority of competitive PC gamers are males. Men have a culture to fall back on, women do not. If women try to join this culture, lets say they play league, they will get hit on constantly for being a women. It's not fun, unless your aim is to make money from it by being a titty streamer of course.

Compare this to a country like Iran, where western high school culture is non-existent, girls and boys are separate until 18, and girls are brought into tech collectively, where they can enjoy the subject without being hit on constantly, and without being judged.

This is not to say we need a theocracy. Hell, I'm agnostic myself. But I am saying that different cultures breed different peoples, and that our current nerd-normal people-jock culture cannot produce an equal outcome for both genders.

Unless of course we mandate the subject, which could change things drastically. 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

""Where are you from?"" A question like this should be easy to answer but I have a different story to tell. I was adopted from Kolkata when I was 8 months old and brought here to the U.S. I don’t remember my birth place. Growing up  in America caused me to feel like an outcast everywhere I went. I wanted to be tall, beautiful and blonde like all the other girls. No one resembled me with my brown skin, bushy eyebrows and curly hair. I was always surrounded by white people and then I'd come home to my white mother. Through the eyes of Americans I was considered Indian but Indians categorized me as American. I never seemed to fit in anywhere. Sometimes even I would forget the rich melanin in my skin, it was so easy to assimilate into white American culture.

Staying connected to my roots was important to my mom so she put me in an Odissi dance group when I was 4 years old. I have spent 16 years with my dance instructor who has taught me so much about my heritage and about who I am. Although I loved going to dance, I found myself getting jealous when my teacher would speak to the other girls and their parents in Hindi or Bengali. It felt bad not knowing what they were talking about. I would gaze over at the girls and the way they looked so much like their mothers. I wanted that. However, I was always able to look past it because although I cannot speak the language and I don't know if I look anything like my biological mom, nothing compares to how I feel a strong sense of belonging behind the dramatic makeup and intricate jewels worn by Odissi dancers. Every step I make to the rhythm and beat immerses my mind. The music overpowers the negativity from the world and I begin to realize this is who I am. The question of my identity ceases to exist because I am home. 

Hope this can help anyone dealing with identity issues due to being adopted. Follow us on instagram.com/Anjalproject to hear more stories. ",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,"Hi!

As well as many, many cis hetero women, I don't want to perpetuate the stereotype of becoming his mother and doing everything in the appartment while getting more and more bitter over time while he lives in undisturbed peace, and he explicitly doesn't want that kind of life either (doesn't want to sacrifice my happiness and our relationship for his own egocentric comfort).

But then again, we had that conversation and i got stuck with the responsibility of coming up with a solution... I don't know if it's just my own relationship pattern or if this is a common feminist issue, but i always seem to find myself with passive men who just can't take things in their own hands apart from their jobs.

Is this a social or personal issue to you..? I read recently about the concept of mental charge as a feminist problem in households and really feel tht it's tricky to get out of, even with good intentions from both parts.

First, he asked what my plans for family were, then when I was kind of non-responsive about it, he asked ""If you get pregnant in a couple of years, what are your plans? Will you come back to work?"", I didn't even know how to answer that because 1) I'm not planning on having kids for probably 10 years at the soonest if at all and 2) I don't really want to talk to a complete stranger about things I haven't even talked to my boyfriend about. 
He also asked me how old I am, which I'm fairly certain is illegal (I'm young), and then went on to say ""the concern with hiring someone so young"", so by answering and confirming my age I might not get the job.
This is a small, family owned company, so I could see how the interviewer probably does not have the tact and concern for lawsuits as a corporate interviewer would, but still it left me feeling really uncomfortable about the whole experience. In all my interviews I've never been asked questions this personal...I'm just curious, are these kinds of questions legal? Do I have to answer? Any additional advice?

Additionally, he told me that he wouldn't be able to field a team, so I suggested that he offer a sport that the kids were interested in.

I have a number of friends who are Arab and Asian and I started asking them about the family structures in their cultures, particularly around birth and child rearing. All of them said that it's a given that a new mother will have a ton of support from parents, aunts, and cousins and this continues really throughout childhood, with families helping it seems like a lot more than they do here. The woman moving into her parents' house is pretty common after birth too.

In the US it seems like there is a strong belief that your family is first and foremost your spouse, then kids, then any other relatives, but it's based around the spouse. Even if your spouse has only known you for a year they're still number 1. And asking for help from family is seen as stunted or immature.

Recently I've been introspecting more and more about feminism, and I think I've realized that like many men, I've been socialized to see women in certain ways.  The more I think about it on a rational level (i.e. trying to imagine it from a woman's perspective), the less it makes sense.  I love sex, I crave it every day with women, but I think the way I see women often involves objectification and entitlement-- but if I was a woman, wouldn't I be offended if my entire humanity was reduced to the pleasure a man derives from my body?  

I recognize that rationally, but I still feel like my thoughts drift towards objectification.  And if I'm honest with myself, I've done things I'm not proud about.  I've texted girls I just met and escalated too quickly with innuendo which reflected entitlement.  What I'm trying to say is, even though I rationally accept feminism, I feel this ambivalence/inner conflict since I feel like my conditioning/interest in pleasure tugs me towards objectifying women.  

I'm also torn over how to separate normal sexuality from objectification.  For example, when I see an attractive woman in the street, I try not to stare, but I automatically have raging sexual thoughts.  In that moment I don't care about her interests or life goals, I just imagine entering her.  Is this wrong?  I'm still thinking about all of this.  And while I accept feminism intellectually, at times I feel reflexively uncomfortable around it.  I really need to work on myself and I'm a little torn on proper sexuality.  Hoping for some advice.

So someone on another subreddit asked and deleted a rant about hating TERFs for excluding trans people, and I had a response I'd like to have a chat about. I also want to say that trans women are women and even if this conversation makes you uncomfortable because you want to support trans rights, I think we still gotta talk about this more, because IMO theres a lot of confusion about sex/gender and how we relate with those, especially when transitioning. So here was my response to an ""anti-TERF"" post.

""What I think is badly needed is a conversation about gender, how that relates to being trans, and how we can all live. Many TERFS exist and they need to be more sympathetic to trans women and accept them as ""real women"", but there is also the fact that, as a feminist, trans people adhering to gender norms is definitely something I have questions about. I'm not saying trans people aren't valid and real and all that supportice stuff, but I think there's a huge amount of stuff within all this gender identity and sex stuff and screaming matches don't help.

I dont want to unite against TERFs who I can convince or understand instead. I'd rather we all listen to each other.

I learned about it while researching more radical forms of feminism so thought I'd approach it with an open mind. 

After reading through it I think it touches on some really great ideas. It's not politically correct to say so considering the blatant misandry represented in in the book, but she touches on some ideas that I have trouble refuting. Ideas like pussy envy and men having a genetic deficiency from birth are surprisingly insightful, especially since lately I've been leaning towards the idea that patriarchy is something men enforce naturally rather than something that is taught. There's also some really good socialist thoughts regarding automation and the obalition of money. 

Yes a lot of it is very man hating but before you call it out as irrational you should do some research on her upbringing and understand what she had been through that may have given her reason to think the way she did. Also a lot of the man hating may not necessarily be unjustified. It's not politically correct so it's easy to recoil at the idea but she really does provide some profound reasoning as to why men have, as she would say, turned the world into a shitpile. Although equality is a goal most of us want, as I've learned about patriarchy it's becoming harder and harder for me to see how we could possibly have a world where men and women could be equal and peaceful at the same time. As long as men continue to be a large portion of the population those seeds of patriarchy will continue to be planted and we'll never see a truly equal society without men being reduced to a minority.

I think our society ""victimizes"" women and when women don't fit into our feminist theories, we say she's an unknowing victim who suffers from some syndrome. We press the label of ""victim"" whether the woman wants it or not.

We found a sign outside a corridor that read 'restrooms'. I told my brother he didn't have to wait for me and that I would just find him once I was done. As we parted ways, a group of four guys were coming outside of the corridor. I didn't think anything of them and made my way to the bathroom but as my gaze met theirs, I got a weird feeling in my gut. I felt uneasy, almost as if I was in a life threatening situation. I quickly ignored the thought and let it slip my mind. But as I continued down the hallway, I heard the guys making comments at me. ""Why is she walking so fast"", ""girl why you running away?"" ""Come here sweet mama"". My heart started racing and I almost felt out of breath. I quickly made it inside the women's bathroom and locked myself in one of the stalls. I could still hear their voices. At this point, I felt my face getting hot and my hands shaking. I called my brother as soon as I could and told him to wait outside for me as I felt unsafe. Once he was there, I stepped outside of the stall and another girl was standing, waiting for me. She told me the same thing had happened to her. She asked to walk out with me and once we stepped outside, they were gone. This incident, although not that serious at all, has me shaken. To everyone out there, please please be extra safe and especially mindful of your instincts. We all have the ability to sense when something wrong is about to happen.

My name is Prester Jane and I am a reformed extremist. I was raised in a hardcore authoritarian cult (I didn't even have a Social Security Number until I was 14) that had its own school and was subjected to considerable mental conditioning and ritual abuse. In my teen years I rebelled against the cult and left it- only to spend the next 15 years joining one cult after another. Eventually I hit rock bottom (which for me was homelessness) and admitted that the problem was me. I got myself some help (thank god for the *Haven for Hope* in San Antonio, Texas) and was able to be successfully deprogrammed. I have been in recovery for five years now.

I have spent the past several years writing a detailed psychological framework that explains how authoritarians think and function with an aim to demystify and humanize authoritarians. I call this the ""Narrativist Framework"". I am currently in the process of putting the Narrativist Framework into a publicly viewable format (it has been primarily developed with the support of a small community on a paywalled forum) in order to do my bit in the resistance. [You can read the entire thing at this link.](http://prestersperspective.blogspot.com/p/narrativist-framework-preface.html) (Takes about 90 minutes to go through the entire thing, most people do it in 2-3 sessions.)

While I am not an academic a fair number of academics have reviewed/supported my work during its development. The general consensus is that many of my ideas have similar counterparts in the academic world, however the way I have connected these ideas is quite novel as well as many of my ideas having their own distinct shade. (Evaporative cooling for example is very similar to my concept of a [Compaction Cycle.](http://prestersperspective.blogspot.com/p/narrativist-framework-compaction-cycle.html)  Many people have commented that after familiarizing themselves with the Narrativist Framework they are able to more readily process and understand what is happening with Trump. In point of fact at present it is possible to watch many of the concepts in the Narrativist Framework demonstrate themselves in real time among Trump supporters.

As you can imagine, there is no TLDR for such material- authoritarians are fundamentally processing reality in a very different manner than you and I and understanding an authoritarian means understanding the different way they are experiencing the exact same events.

I will be monitoring this thread and will be more than happy to answer any questions about the Narrativist Framework. I am interested in getting a dialogue going around my work because I think it provides the best way presently available to understand authoritarians and how they rose to such prominence in the modern American zeitgeist.",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,ITT a reformed authoritarian cultist explains how Trump manipulates people and takes the communities questions.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/6vcwg2/itt_a_reformed_authoritarian_cultist_explains_how/

My name is Raquel Craney, and I’m a student in the Counseling Psychology Doctoral program at the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC), conducting research regarding bisexual women’s sexual experiences, discrimination, coping, and distress. In order to voluntarily participate in this study, you must a) identify as a bisexual woman (or identify with the experience of being a woman who is attracted to people of the same gender and people of genders different than you), b) be 18 years of age or older, and c) live in the United States. We would like to provide a TRIGGER WARNING because this survey asks questions about unwanted sexual experiences. We are very interested in hearing from BISEXUAL WOMEN OF COLOR, although women from all racial and ethnic backgrounds are welcome to participate.

If you are interested in participating, you will be asked to complete an anonymous online survey that will take approximately 20 to 30 minutes, one time only. If you are interested in participating, please click on the following link: https://umkc.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_eII5JmAeCcklliZ

Or, if you would like further information, please email Laurel Watson at watsonlb@umkc.edu

For your participation, you may choose to enter a raffle to win one of eight $25.00 Amazon.com gift cards.

This study, protocol number 16-505, was submitted to the UMKC IRB and determined to be exempt from IRB regulations. If you have any concerns about your rights as a participant your concerns please call 816-235-5927

Thanks for your consideration, and please feel free to share widely!

MY JOURNAL ENTRY:
How do I do this?  So much bothered me before he called Kaepernik a “nigger” in an unprovoked outburst of anger.  But I’m trying to clear and sort through the emotions and ramifications.  I’m not the same person I was 5 years ago; not so diminutive, not so agreeable and not so obedient.  He’s not the same—he used to use his personal power for good; now he uses it to run his very own little dictatorship (wiki=one who rules by force or fear) where he eviscerates any and every one close to him on a daily, mood-dependent tirade.  Every “gift” is conditional (and will be thrown in your face daily), including his affection.  Everything has to be his way…he makes no room for personal growth because he rejects and talks over or screams or intimidates everyone into shutting the fuck up, rather than engage with him.
I know his pain is a factor, his pain pills are as well (when he has them AND when he doesn’t both), his father’s death, his kids, this fucking zoo…but it begs the question: “What is too much guarding his ego and reason at the expense of my core beliefs being compromised?”

I love him.   I care about his ego and his self-esteem, so how do I tell him he’s become hard to be around because of his anger and depression.  I should be part of the solution….this feels like the physical fight we had 7 years ago, except I’m not running away from him, nor am I going to have my human rights beliefs and me disrespected.  At the end of the day we are both solution-oriented people and I’m hopeful we will find a way to come together.

Hey I love you too.....However I am stressed to the Max right now with the Pain and kids and now You.  I do love you but right now find myself overwhelmed...Financially we are a train wreck right now.  You got a job for 2 days and threw me a thirty spot (which is what it cost me in gas)  The rest of you talk revolved around paying you and other people and also a trip to DC (Which you must ask yourself how you would be handling things if you were me and I finally got paid and wanted to take a roadtrip with the boys??????? But here is where how much I care about you comes in as I put you first when it comes to your well being..... I have sold off a bunch of my guns to keep you with the supplies you need.  Because I do love you...  We smoking waaaaay tooo much:(  We need to write down every dime spent from now on.  You don't want me to look at you and think of Poverty,  however you are in constant need of supplies....U KILLIN ME SMALLS..(HELP)...as you see I am trying to get my project up and running.....For obvious reasons I couldn't do it earlier due to my fucktard kids.  I am going to quit smoking for sure   (Partially due to me not being to afford it  and partially for me because I know I won't make it very long if I continue...which if that is what it takes for me to quit   then so be it...:)  )   As far as Colin is concerned he disgusts me in every way...anyone who can disrespect the very people who have fought and DIED for his freedom and very right to speak so he can throw a fucking hissy fit is a piece of shit no matter what his race is...I keep my mouth quiet about the BLM matter because BLM and the neo-nazis and white supremacist are all fucking terrorist groups PERIOD   So at the end of the day it works out much better for us to keep our political views to ourselves as I have unfollowed you on FB too for obvious reasons.  So I love you and want to get healthy with you and down the road we can reap the many benefits of being healthy and being able to travel and take cruises and then we can find happiness    I have decided that I want to get healthy and enjoy the years ahead.....I don't think anyone on the Planet cares about you as much as I do.....I think you know that....XXXXOOOOXXXX  As I lose weight  my MOJO will return as well...TRUTH  Love u

On the advert were drawings of a dollar symbol, a handbag, high-heeled shoes, a wallet and a skirt (I can only assume the symbols were representing what ""not to wear"").

Passing by the billboard I first thought that the ad was outrageously sexist (first there is no reason to assume that only women need to defend themselves against potential attackers, and second that would be completely sexist to advise women not to wear some clothes to be safer, the problem clearly lies on the attacker mind's side, not on the victim's...)

Then I thought of something which in this case sounds a little ridiculous but can yet be thought of... I thought that maybe I was the one being sexist in the first place assuming out of the blue that a skirt, high-heeled shoes or a handbag are women clothing.

This seems like a terrible definition to me, and I don't agree with it at all. To me, racism is prejudice based on skin color. Sexism is prejudice based on sex. If a white person is denied a job because they're white, that should be considered racism.

First of all, let me get out of the way, I'm by no means saying that the rapist isn't in the wrong, at any point in the process he is 100% to blame, and should be punished as such, however, I will still argue that it's not a ""good idea"" to wear scant clothes, as they attract a rapist, and going into shady areas, where it is easier to rape, as these both increase your chances. It doesn't become your fault, no, but I'd argue it's somewhat similar to walking around in expensive clothes, with expensive paraphernalia into a shady area, if you get robbed, it's not your fault. The thief is 100% in the wrong, but you're still not helping the situation. 

I also acknowledge that a lot of rape happen by people you think wouldn't do it, with cases like being drugged, and at times the woman couldn't do anything to change the course of action, and I couldn't imagine what that's like,but I'm referring to other cases of rape, where it happens in an alley or elsewhere, where the woman is left vulnerable. 

I also acknowledge the argument that women shouldn't have to do this, and I couldn't agree more. However, this is a cruel world, and until the point where rape cases are nearly unheard of (which is probably as far as we could achieve), decreasing your chances is frankly the most one can do.

I'd like to invite you all to Girls on Film's event, Turning the Tables. 

The event is in London, Hackney on September 21st. The theme of the evening is to comment on how few women there are working in the film and DJing industries. ((This is not because there is a lack of talent but because there is an assumption that women are somehow less qualified!))

This event aims to 'turn the tables' by showcasing some excellent female DJs and female directors. We will be showcasing 5 short music related films directed by women. After the screening there will be a panel discussion with directors as well as women working in the music industry. Here are the some of the questions the panel will be discussing: 

What do female composers have to say about their place in their chosen professional world? What struggles - and advantages - afford a music video director if she's a woman? How do female filmmakers marry sound and image to their end?

Person 2: ""I worked somewhere once where a girl thought I was staring at her and I wasn't, was called-in to HR.""

## What is period poverty?

The idea that a woman or girl being forced to use rags, socks or newspaper because she can't access sanitary products may seem like a distant nightmare only affecting underdeveloped countries. Widespread [poverty](http://imgur.com/a/LRiYd) and menstruation still being taboo can lead to conditions like these happening in western nations today.

Period poverty refers to the inability of women and girls from deprived backgrounds to afford or [access](http://imgur.com/a/wsNAZ) sanitary products. [Many women and girls](http://i.imgur.com/t2Rk3uj.png) go for extended periods without appropriate sanitary protection causing damage to educational and career progress as well as high impact on a person's self-esteem and physical and mental health.

For more information please read [Rosa's infographic](http://www.rosauk.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Spotlight-Period-Poverty.pdf) on period poverty.

&amp;nbsp;

## Where is period poverty found?

Period poverty is found all over the world from [sub-Saharan Africa](http://blogs.worldbank.org/education/globally-periods-are-causing-girls-be-absent-school) to [Australia](https://overland.org.au/2016/08/bloody-girls-on-periods-and-poverty/) &amp; [New Zealand](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11818822), from [India &amp; Pakistan](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/georgina-barnard/menstrual-matters_b_16784730.html) to the [USA](https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/helping-women-and-girls-period/?mcubz=1), and from the favelas of [Brazil](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22078192) to the [United Kingdom](http://www.refinery29.uk/2017/07/162540/period-poverty-uk).

This post will be focusing on period poverty in the [English speaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_world#/media/File:Countries_with_English_as_Official_Language.png) developed world.

&amp;nbsp;

## Why are we focusing on western nations?

As this is our first attempt at subreddit activism we have chosen western English speaking nations for ease. It is simpler for this subreddit and its users to find information about period poverty in English speaking countries and for activism to occur. Our next activism post in October will focus on period poverty in developing states such as various African and South Asian nations.

&amp;nbsp;

## Why choose to focus on period poverty?

Period poverty has been in the [news](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/mar/17/girls-from-poorer-families-in-england-struggle-to-afford-sanitary-protection) a lot recently. As a feminist subreddit, we have decided to join the activism being done by a variety of other organisations. This subreddit believes that as one of the largest feminist websites worldwide, we have a duty towards feminist activism and advocacy.

***

Some of the first European women to speak out for themselves, and for their sex, did so within a religious framework, and in religious terms. It is perhaps not always easy, in our secular society, to bring them back to life: to recognize fully their courage, or to understand the implications, or the extent, of their challenge to the status quo.

For centuries, and all over Europe, there were families who disposed of ‘unnecessary’ or unmarriageable daughters by shutting them away in convents. For some, this must have felt like life imprisonment; but for others, conventual quiet seems to have facilitated genuine fulfilment: it allowed some women to develop a talent for organization, and some were able to read and think, and discover their own distinctive voices. Hildegard of Bingen, who was born at the end of the 11th century and became a nun, and later the abbess, of a small Rhineland convent, has long been known as a remarkable and impressive writer; recently, her great musical talent has been rediscovered and celebrated. But she was sometimes plagued with doubts about her ‘unfeminine’ activities, and wrote to one of the leading churchmen of the time, Bernard of Clairvaux, asking if she – an uneducated woman – should continue with her writing and with composing. He encouraged her, and within a few years she was known and honoured all over Europe. When she was 60 years old, she embarked upon preaching tours all through the German empire, even though at that time only priests were allowed to preach.

Like other medieval women, when seeking to imagine the almost unimaginable, and to communicate her understanding of God’s love, she turned to womanly, and specifically maternal, experience, and wrote of the ‘motherhood’ of God. ‘God showed me his grace again’, she writes, ‘as . . . when a mother offers her weeping child milk.’ Some religious women imagine, with maternal tenderness, the infant Jesus. A Flemish Beguine meditates on what the mother of God must have felt:

&gt;for three or more days [she] held Him close to her so that He nestled between her breasts like a baby . . . sometimes she kissed him as though he were a little child and sometimes she held Him on her lap as if He were a gentle lamb.

‘Just because I am a woman, must I therefore believe that I must not tell you about the goodness of God . . . ?’ asked the Englishwoman Julian of Norwich in the early 15th century. She marveled that ‘he who was her Maker chose to be born of the creature that is made’. Moreover, she argued:

&gt;our Saviour is our true mother in whom we are eternally born and by whom we shall always be enclosed . . . We are redeemed by the motherhood of mercy and grace . . . to the nature of motherhood belong tender love, wisdom and knowledge, and it is good, for although the birth of our body is only low, humble and modest compared with the birth of our soul, yet it is he who does it in the beings by women it was done.

Whereas other women had made the analogy briefly, Julian of Norwich goes on to spell out the comparison very directly. Christ is like

&gt;the kind, loving mother who knows and recognizes the need of her child, and carefully watches over it. The mother can give her child milk to suck, but our dear mother Jesus can feed us with himself, and he does so most generously and most tenderly . . .

Margery Kempe, a contemporary of Julian’s who travelled from her Essex home to visit her, produced an account of her own life – probably dictated to a scribe – that has been described as the first autobiography in English. Her life story reveals, only too clearly, why her self-preoccupation and her melodramatic acting out of her own miseries infuriated so many people who came into contact with her. But her story is also, unexpectedly, a deeply touching one; and more than that, it is impressive simply because she insists on taking herself and her experiences seriously. Margery came up against the painful and terrible aspect of the motherhood that had inspired the celibate Julian. She was miserably ill all through her first pregnancy, and after a prolonged and very painful birth, was left exhausted and depressed: ‘what with the labour she had in childbirthing and the sicknesse going before, she despaired of her life’. At times, she came near to killing herself. She was comforted, she recalls, by a vision of Christ, in the form of a handsome young man sitting at her bedside; he informed her that ‘you may boldly, when you are in bed, take me to you as your wedded husband’. But it was only years later, and after 14 pregnancies, that Margery finally managed to negotiate a deal with her demanding mortal husband: if he stopped insisting on sex, she would pay off his debts, and forgo her strict Friday fast to eat and drink with him. He agreed, though with a hint of sarcasm that echoes nastily across the centuries: ‘May your body be as freely available to God as it has been to me.’

With remarkable energy and determination, Margery then set out across Europe on a pilgrimage, and though her constant weeping and wailing so infuriated her fellow pilgrims that they abandoned her en route, her courage – and obsessive determination – enabled her to reach Jerusalem, and eventually to get as far as Constantinople.

By the late 16th century, increasing numbers of women were beginning to argue their case more consistently and more aggressively, though still within a religious framework. The Reformation enabled more women to receive an education. In

1589, in what one historian has called ‘the earliest piece of English feminist polemic’, Jane Anger took up a challenging position by insisting that Eve was superior to Adam: a second, and hence improved, model. Whereas Adam was fashioned from ‘dross and filthy clay’, God made Eve from Adam’s flesh, ‘that she might be purer than he’, which ‘doth evidently show how far we women are more excellent than men . . . From woman sprang man’s salvation. A woman was the first that believed, and a woman likewise the first that repented of sin.’ Anger then descends crossly, and comically, to everyday domestic life. It is women, she reminds us, who make sure that men are fed, clothed, and cleaned: ‘without our care they lie in their beds as dogs in litter, and go like lousy mackerel swimming in the heat of summer’.

But any woman wanting to defend her sex had to tackle powerfully negative scriptural images of women: Delilah was treacherous, Jezebel murderous, while Eve was directly responsible for the Fall of the human race: ‘the woman tempted him and he did eat’. Saint Paul was regularly invoked against any woman who spoke out, or asked awkward questions about the Church’s attitude to women: ‘Let your women keep silence in the churches, for it is not permitted to them to speak’, he instructed the Corinthians. And again, in the epistle to Timothy, ‘if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home: for it is shame for women to speak in the church’.

Gradually, a few women found the confidence to defy these scriptural prohibitions. Some offered dissenting interpretations of Genesis, arguing that Adam was, after all, as much to blame for the Fall as Eve. So, in 1611, Aemilia Lanyer reminded her readers that Christ

&gt;was begotten of a woman, born of a woman, nourished of a woman, obedient to a woman . . . he healed women, pardoned women, comforted women . . . after his resurrection, appeared first to a woman.

And Rachel Speght sardonically remarked in 1617:

&gt;If Adam had not approved that deed which Eve had done, and been willing to tread the steps which she had gone, he being her head would have reproved her, have made the commandment a bit to restrain him from breaking his master’s position.

Others insisted that God had signalled his forgiveness by making Mary, a descendant of Eve, the mother of Christ.

In the course of the troubled 17th century, particularly among the sects, the many and various small groups that rejected the established Church in favour of purer forms of worship, women found more freedom. Some, at least, felt inspired to preach or to prophesy. Modern historians have pointed out the important role of women among the religious separatists who fled persecution in late Elizabethan England by emigrating to America or to Holland, as well as their activity as preachers. Women were active, too, among the small dissenting groups that managed to survive underground in England, until, during the Civil War and

Interregnum, they emerged dramatically and vocally. Keith Thomas lists some of these independent congregations: Brownists, Independents, Baptists, Millenarians, Familists, Quakers, Seekers, Ranters. Whatever their theological differences, they all believed the necessity for spiritual regeneration in every individual. The experiencing of what Quakers called the ‘Inner Light’ was more important than external observance – and that light knows no sexual distinction. As one contemporary writer claimed, ‘one faithful man, yea, or woman either, may as truly and effectually loose and bind, both in heaven and earth, as all the ministers in the world’.

Various independent congregations had, for some time, been allowing women to debate publicly and to vote on matters of  Church business; by the 1640s some, particularly among the Quakers, were going further. In 1659, the Quaker Fox argued that ‘Christ is in the male as in the female, who redeems from under the Law . . . Christ in the male and female, who are in the spirit of God, are not under the Law.’

‘Might not the spirit of Christ, that is begotten of God in the female as well as the male . . . speak?’ asked Katherine Evans and Sarah Chevers. Increasingly often, women felt moved, divinely inspired, to speak in meetings and even at service, though they were often greeted with bitter opposition. They were criticized for being ‘puffed up with pride’ and ‘vainglorious arrogance’, and even worse, for ‘usurping authority over men’. In 1646, for example, John Vicars complained bitterly about ‘bold impudent housewives . . . without all womanly modesty who take upon them . . . to prate . . . most directly contrary to the apostle’s inhibition’.

John Bunyan was totally opposed to this active participation by women, arguing that Satan, inevitably, tempts the weaker Eve, rather than Adam: ‘the man was made the head in worship, and the keeper of the garden of God’. He referred to women as ‘that simple and weak sex’. Citing the first epistle to the Corinthians, he argued that women are ‘not the image and glory of God as the men are. They are placed beneath.’ He disapproved of separate women’s meetings, which did nothing but encourage ‘unruliness’. ‘I do not believe they [women] should minister to God in prayer before the whole church,’ he insisted, adding sarcastically, ‘for then I should be a Ranter or a Quaker.’ In any public gathering, ‘her part is to hold her tongue, to learn in silence’

Even in the 1670s, that courageous Quaker Margaret Fell still felt the need to defend women’s independence of conscience, and their right to play an active part in worship. In a tract called Women’s Speaking Justified, she argued emphatically: ‘Those that speak against . . . the spirit of the Lord speaking in a woman, simply by reason of her sex . . . speak against Christ and his Church, and are of the Seed of the Serpent.’

The prophet Joel was sometimes cited as an answer to Saint Paul’s prohibition spirit upon all flesh:

&gt; . . . and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood and fire, and pillars of smoke.

Joel’s ecstatic vision seemed, to many, particularly relevant during the great upheavals caused by the Civil War and the Interregnum; there was a widespread feeling that apocalypse was, indeed, imminent. The sect who styled themselves Fifth Monarchists, for example, believed that the world’s four great secular empires – Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome – having passed away, the fifth – Christ’s Kingdom and the rule of the saints – was close at hand. In this feverish and volatile climate, prophets, many with revolutionary ideas, flourished.

In this area, a woman’s supposed passivity, her receptivity to outside influence, could, ironically, be claimed as an advantage: she might prove more receptive, more open, to becoming a channel for the voice of God. The Belgian prophet Antonia Bourigue, who was widely read in England, produced a disconcerting and double-edged justification: ‘they ought to let God speak by a woman, if it be His Pleasure, since he spoke in former times to a Prophet by a Beast’.

But the line between prophetic inspiration and lunacy, between possession by God and by the devil, was a narrow one. In 17th-century England, women were still being tried for witchcraft. Moreover, female prophets could easily be dismissed as merely crazy. Lady Eleanor Davis, for example, had been claiming divine inspiration for years; early one morning in 1625, she heard ‘a Voice from Heaven, speaking as through a trumpet these words, There is nineteen years and a half to the Judgement Day’. She went on to publish tracts that were interpreted as predicting, amongst other things, the death of Charles I. Her husband burned her books; and she was often the butt of jokes. An anagram of her name – Dame Eleanor Davis: Never so mad a ladie – was gleefully circulated. But her visionary fervour put her at real risk; even her rank could not protect her from charges of treachery. In 1633, after being charged before the High Commission that ‘she took upon her (which much unbeseemed her sex) not only to interpret the Scriptures . . . but also to be a prophetess’, she was fined and imprisoned in Bedlam. But she came into her own during the Interregnum, when many of her prophecies seemed to have been realized. She went on to publish at least 37 tracts between 1641 and her death 11 years later.

Another prophetess, Anna Trapnel, experienced some kind of revelation at a Baptist church in London. By 1652, she had joined the Fifth Monarchists, and in 1654, she accompanied a male preacher to Whitehall, where she fell into a trance that lasted for 12 days. Crowds gathered to hear her prophecies – and her harsh criticisms of Oliver Cromwell and his government – which were recorded in Strange and Wonderful News from Whitehall and The Cry of a Stone. She insisted – in verse – that God’s message was addressed to women as well as men:

&gt;John though wilt not offended beThat handmaids here should sing, That they should meddle to declare The matters of the King . . . .

The authorities labelled her as mad, but still brought her to trial. ‘The report was that I would discover myself to be a witch when I came before the justices, by having never a word to answer for myself’, she said. But her sheer volubility defeated the court, and she continued, undeterred, with her prophecies. Cromwell’s government undoubtedly took this kind of prediction seriously; several times, he and his council were interrupted by, and seriously listened to, prophets, several of whom were women.

The appeal to divine inspiration was probably of limited value as a means of female emancipation; the feminism of the future would depend less on the assertion of women’s spiritual equality and more on natural rights, and a denial that there is any intellectual difference between the sexes.

But there were political implications to this outburst of religious fervour. In the 16th century, the Anabaptists had recognized women as equal to men, and allowed them to pray and speak in meetings. Women from the congregations who styled themselves Levellers seem to have been particularly active on a larger stage, and showed considerable political shrewdness. The sect encouraged women’s activity, believing in the equality of all ‘made in the image of God’. In the 1640s and early 1650s, when many of their husbands were in prison, Leveller women repeatedly turned up en masse at

Westminster – staging what sounds very like contemporary ‘demonstrations’ – to demand freedom for their husbands, but also to complain bitterly about their own, consequent hardships. They were usually treated harshly, and rebuked for meddling in things beyond their understanding. The crowds of women who petitioned for peace in 1642 and 1643 were dismissed contemptuously as ‘Whores, Bawds, Oyster women, Kitchen maids’. Three hundred women, who presented another petition to the House of Lords, were rejected out of hand by the Duke of Lennox. ‘Away with these women,’ he exclaimed, adding, with a jeer, ‘we were best have a Parliament of women.’ In May 1649 yet another petition for the release of the Leveller prisoners was turned away sarcastically: ‘It was not for women to Petition, they might stay at home and wash the dishes.’ To which the women, unabashed, retorted, ‘we have scarcely any dishes left us to wash’.

Later in that year, they tried again. As many as ten thousand women signed yet another petition, asking:

&gt;We cannot but wonder and grieve that we should appear so despicable in your eyes as to be thought unworthy to petition to represent our grievances to this honourable House. Have we not an equal interest with the men of this nation in those liberties and securities contained in the Petition of Right, and other good laws of the land? Are any of our lives, limbs, liberties or goods to be taken from us, no more than from men, but by due process of law . . .

A thousand women carried it to the House with sea-green ribbons pinned to their breasts. Once again, they were dismissed scornfully.

But among the Quakers, particularly, women found the chance to develop their skills as administrators. Regular women’s meetings were set up alongside the men’s meetings in the 1650s; and though, from the beginning, women seem to have concentrated on traditionally feminine areas, such as welfare and moral problems, they had the chance to develop their own, very effective organization, which in fact handled considerable sums of money. However, historians have suggested that there was a gradual reduction in the scope of their concerns; by the 1680s, they were confining themselves to ‘womanly’ matters. In these later years, they concentrated on ‘such things as are proper to us, as the poor more especially and the destitute amongst us’. These included helping young men to find apprenticeships or work, and instructing younger women ‘to all wholesome things’, which included looking after their husbands, children, and homes, and always behaving in a manner that was ‘discreet, chaste, and sober’.

On Reddit, obviously, there are some pretty toxic misogynistic places where people group together to - sometimes - throw extreme abuse at women, and even suggest that we are subhuman and should be kept as sex slaves and the like. 

But it's easy to laugh at these people or pity them because they're deluded and outside of the mainstream - some of the misogyny is so extreme it's hard to even comprehend.

What really pisses me off is the subtle sexism on other mainstream subs. *Everyone* assumes you're a guy. Even if your username is a female name like mine. And if you bother to correct them, you're downvoted and accused of attention-seeking. So the myth that all Internet users are male prevails.

Then there's the fact that even though ~apparently~ everyone here is a dude, the majority of AskReddit posts about sexism *are specifically targeted at guys*. Just search ""sexism"" in your search bar and you'll see what I mean. ""Men of Reddit, what sexism have you faced?"" Questions targeted at women tend to be ""Women of Reddit, how can I make myself more attractive to you?""

Then sexist remarks, jokes and/or slurs are pretty common-place in many other subs and pass by unnoticed. There's a general hegemony for the ""ugh, SJW"" culture. 

I know many people have pointed this out before, but I'm pretty new here and wanted to get involved in some feminist reaction because I'm pretty much an Internet addict and sometimes we have to forge out our own space.

Secular self-assertion, perhaps inevitably, developed more slowly; it was one thing to act in ‘unfeminine’ ways if divinely inspired, not quite so easy to act unconventionally out of personal ambition.

Speaking in public, or writing, was all very well when it was in the Lord’s cause, and could be claimed as the product of divine inspiration: ‘I am a very weak and unworthy woman . . . I could do no more of myself than a pencil or pen can do when no hand guides it’, acknowledged one 17th-century female author. Moreover, many women, Quakers and members of other sects, obviously gained confidence from being part of a supportive community with whom they shared beliefs and values.

Worldly ambition was something else. There had of course been, within living memory of many, a great queen of England, who was learned and well read. Working with the scholar Roger Ascham, Elizabeth became fluent in Latin, Greek, and French; he remarked, approvingly, that ‘her mind has no womanly weakness, her perseverance is equal to that of a man’. But for all her self-assertiveness, she was hardly supportive of other women. Her famous speech to the troops at Tilbury in (1588) made a sharp distinction between her role as woman and as monarch: ‘I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and a king of England too.’ But her mere existence was probably an encouragement, at least, to some Englishwomen, to trust in their own talents, and to accept their own ‘unfeminine’ ambition. There were certainly Royalist women who – in the absence of their husbands during the Civil War – struggled bravely to defend their families and homes. Anne Bradstreet (an English-born poet who later emigrated to America) wrote, 40 years after the Queen’s death:

&gt;Let such as say our sex is void of reason

&gt;Know ’tis a slander now, but once was Treason.

 An anonymous work entitled *The Woman’s Sharpe Revenge* (1640) argued, provocatively, that women’s exclusion from learning was ‘devised by men to secure their own continued domination’. Bathsua Makin, who was governess to a daughter of Charles I and who later founded and ran a school for women, insisted in her *Essay to Revive the Ancient Education of Gentlewomen in Religion, Manners, Arts and Tongues* on the importance of women receiving a solid education. ‘Let women be fools’, she remarked, ‘and you will make them slaves.’ Her book was probably, in part at least, an advertisement for her school and its curriculum; and it was aimed at well-off women. Interestingly, she offered women the (still rare) chance to study the classics. But she reassured her readers by making it clear that she would not ‘hinder good housewifery, neither have I called any from their necessary labour to the book’. And, with a hint of anxiety, she insists that ‘my intention is not to equalize women to men, much less to make them superior. They are the weaker sex.’

But Bathsua Makin warmly praised the role played by Royalist women during the Civil War: they ‘defended their houses and did all things, as soldiers, with prudence and valour, like men’. And she was generously appreciative of her learned contemporaries, including Anne Bradstreet and the Duchess of Newcastle. The biblical story of how Eve brought sin into the world by eating the forbidden apple, so often used against women, is, Makin argues, merely the earliest example of a need for adequate education.

**Christine de Pizan

Christine de Pizan, born in 14th-century Italy but raised in France, has been described as the first Western woman to live by her pen. Well educated by her father, she began writing aged 25, after her husband died, earning enough to support three children, a niece, and her own mother. Her most famous work, The City of Ladies (1404), criticizes learned books that spread ‘so many wicked insults about women and their behaviour’; three allegorical women – Reason, Rectitude, and Justice – discuss the roots of misogyny. ‘The man or the woman in whom resides greater virtue is the higher’, she argued; ‘neither the loftiness nor the lowliness of a person lies in the body according to the sex, but in the perfection of conduct and virtues.’

In 1599 Marguerite de Navarre published the *Heptaméron*, defending women against misogynous attacks. Marie de Gournay’s *Egalité des hommes et des femmes* (1622) asserted women’s intellectual equality with men: ‘happy are you, Reader, if you do not belong to this sex to which all good is forbidden’. And in 1640, Anne Marie van Schurmann’s *On the Capacity of the Female Mind for Learning* insisted that ‘whatever fills the human mind with uncommon and honest delight is fitting for a human woman’.**

Many early secular writers seem to have had a hard time. In 1621 Lady Mary Wroth (a niece of the poet Sir Philip Sidney) was engaged in writing a sonnet sequence, which she left unfinished. It was not printed until the 20th century, when women literary critics analysed the interesting and refreshing slant she brought to that usually intensely masculine form. But when Wroth had the temerity to *publish* a prose romance, *The Countess of Montgomery’s Urania*, it was greeted with hostility, and, on the grounds that it slandered contemporaries, withdrawn from sale. Her rank offered no protection. ‘Work, Lady, work,’ Lord Denny advised Lady Mary, condescendingly, ‘let writing books alone/For surely wiser women ne’er wrote one.’

The difficulties – indeed, the outspoken scorn – confronting any woman who actually dared to publish her writings are clearly indicated by the experiences of Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle. Born into a family of well-established, Royalist East Anglian landowners, she went to court as a young woman, then accompanied Queen Henrietta Maria into exile in Paris, where she met and married the Marquess, later the Duke, of Newcastle. Her privileges – rank and riches – certainly protected her; but they also, along with her flamboyantly eccentric personal style and, most of all, her unconcealed literary ambition, made her an easy target for malicious and denigrating gossip. She was fortunate in her marriage; the Duke, much older than his wife, encouraged her endeavours, and, after one of the many attacks on her work, remarked: ‘Here’s the crime, a lady writes them, and to entrench so much upon the male prerogative is not to be forgiven.’

Though her situation was, in many respects, very different from that of most other women, she wrote very movingly about women’s common fears and griefs, particularly about their children: ‘the care for their well being, the fear for their ill doing, the grief for their sickness and their unsufferable sorrow for their death’. These were concerns that might afflict any woman, whatever her status.

Cavendish began to write philosophical verse when she and her husband returned to London; as a modern biographer remarks, she felt torn between ‘the (feminine and Christian) virtue of modesty’ and her own ambitions. She rightly took her work very seriously, but she was often forced to retreat into defensive, and self-deprecating, justifications. Writing was, she remarked apologetically, the ‘harmlessest pastime’ for leisured women; much better than, say, sitting around gossiping about the neighbours. It was a ‘proper and virtuous’ activity, and men who disapproved, she argued, should hope their own wives and daughters ‘may employ the time no worse than in honest, innocent and harmless fancies’.

However, Cavendish certainly never regarded her own work as harmless fancy. Though she was critical of the exclusive arrogance of the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford, she courageously dedicated two books to them. In 1653, when she published *Poems and Fancies*, she claimed that she wrote because ‘all heroic actions, public employments, powerful governments and eloquent pleadings are denied our sex in this age . . . ’. The implication being that writing in itself may be a heroic activity; and for any woman of her generation, it probably was. Moreover, in her 1655

*Philosophical and Physical Opinions*, she complained that

&gt;we are kept like birds in cages to hop up and down in our houses, not suffered to fly abroad . . . we are shut out of all power and authority, by reason we are never employed either in civil or martial affairs, our counsels are despised and laughed at, the best of our actions are trodden down with scorn, by the overweening conceit men have of themselves and through despisement of us.

But in nature, she argued in the preface to *The World’s Olio*, written when she first returned to London but published in 1655, ‘we have as clear an understanding as men, if we were bred in schools to mature our brains and to mature our knowledge’.

But for all her ambition and her persistence, she had few illusions and sometimes, inevitably perhaps, her courage failed her; she gloomily predicted readers’ responses to her autobiographical *True Relation*: ‘Why hath this lady writ her own life, since none cares to know whose daughter she was or whose wife she is, or how she was bred, or what fortunes she had, or how she lived?’

**2. Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, was an intellectually astute writer who spoke out eloquently against the hostility directed at any woman regarded as outspoken or ambitious.**

And, indeed, readers were often unkind. The diarist Samuel Pepys, intensely and maliciously curious, spent weeks in 1667 tracking her around London, then, after reading her life of her husband, condemned her as ‘a mad, conceited, ridiculous woman’. And though Cavendish hopefully dedicated two prefaces specifically to women readers, urging them to spend time ‘on anything that may bring honour to our sex, for they are poor, dejected spirits that are not ambitious of fame’, she admitted that convention, in constraining women’s talents, made them jealously critical of each other’s achievements, and that she would probably ‘be censured by my own sex’. As she often was. Her contemporary Dorothy Osborne’s response to Newcastle’s Poems and Fancies is sadly revealing about the extent of disapproving prejudice – even amongst intelligent women – against women’s writing. Dorothy was enjoyably shocked when she heard about the Duchess’s book, and wrote to her fiancé, Sir William Temple:

&gt;For God’s sake, if you meet with it, send it me; they say ’tis ten times more extravagant than her dress. Sure, the poor woman is a little distracted, she could never be so ridiculous else as to venture at writing books, and in verse too. If I should not sleep this fortnight I should not come to that.

She wrote again shortly afterwards, telling Temple not to bother, as she had already obtained and read the book, ‘ . . . and am satisfied that there are many soberer people in Bedlam’. But, ironically and rather sadly, Osborne’s own letters to her fiancé reveal a lively, observant, articulate woman; as Virginia Woolf remarked, ‘what a gift that untaught and solitary girl had for the framing of a sentence, for the fashioning of a scene’. In another age, she implies, Osborne might have made a novelist.

Intriguingly, the seedy and cynical world of Restoration London provided some unexpected opportunities for women. They might work as actresses, though that was hardly a socially respectable profession; they were often treated as if they were, in essence, merely prostitutes. But in addition, a number of women emerged as playwrights: Catherine Trotter, Mary Manley, and Mary Pix all had plays produced – and were cruelly mocked in a play by a certain ‘W. M.’ which was staged in 1696. Mary Manley, in the prologue to her first play, foresaw the difficulties they would all face:

&gt;The Curtain’s drawn now by a Lady’s hand

&gt;The very name you’ll cry bodes Impotence,

&gt;To Fringe and Tea they should confine their sense.

Aphra Behn is the best-known of these women who were finding the courage to break new ground, and to face down this kind of jeering criticism. Virginia Woolf glimpsed something of Behn’s importance, describing her as

&gt;a middle class woman with all the plebeian virtues of humour, vitality and courage; a woman forced by the death of her husband and some unfortunate adventures of her own to make her living by her wits, she had to work on equal terms with men. She made, by working very hard, enough to live on. The importance of that fact outweighs anything she actually wrote.

More recent readers have taken what Behn ‘actually wrote’ much more seriously – she was a skilful and often challenging dramatist – while some critics have found her life almost as interesting as her plays. Before becoming a writer, she had travelled widely – perhaps to Surinam in South America; certainly, as a government spy, to the Low Countries. Though she is best known as a playwright, she also penned *Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister*. A recent biographer has convincingly argued that this neglected tale is in fact a great erotic novel, which is also a profound exploration of the potency and the perils of romantic fantasy.

She was often attacked – as male playwrights were not – for bawdiness. Alexander Pope was the most famous of those who sneered at her immorality: ‘The stage how loosely doth Astraea tread/ Who fairly puts all characters to bed.’ Behn defended herself eloquently:

Had the plays I have writ come forth under any man’s name, and never known to have been mine; I appeal to all unbiased judges of sense if they had not said that person had made as good comedies, as any one man that has writ in our age; but a devil on’t the woman damns the poet . . . I value fame as much as if I had been born a hero.

In fact, a play like *The Rover* is a cool, clear-eyed analysis of how women have to manoeuvre, negotiate – and inevitably compromise – in their dealings with men, who are portrayed, almost uniformly, as cold-hearted exploiters. Behn’s heroine Hellena – through a combination of luck, wit, shrewd calculation, and skill at roleplaying – achieves respectability (though almost certainly not happiness) in marriage to the predatory Willmore. But there are hints that Behn may have sympathized most, and perhaps even identified, not with the (more or less) virtuous Hellena, but with the whore Angellica Bianca. As modern critics have pointed out, the heroine and her creator share the same initials. Angellica, ironically, is at heart an idealist, and as such alone among a cast of cynics and manipulators. She believes her seducer’s fine romantic words, and at the close of the play she is excluded, left bitter and disillusioned. Behn’s ending leaves us disconcerted, uncomfortable, questioning, for Behn’s sympathies, and ours, are undoubtedly with the hapless Angellica. In a postscript defending her play against charges of plagiarism (women were especially vulnerable to dismissive sneers about their ability), Behn admitted that though she might ‘have stoln some hints’ from an earlier work by Thomas Killigrew, ‘the Plot and Bus’ness (not to boast on’t ) is my own’. And she continued with an ambiguous statement that seems to confirm some kind of personal identification with her unhappy character: ‘I, vainly proud of my judgement, hang out the Sign of Angellica (the only stolen Object) to give Notice where a great part of the Wit dwelt.’

I am sorry but I do not recall the author or title but I think the author went on to be quite well known. What I remember about it:
- First-person depiction of a woman's experience in her first academic appointment at an Ivy League campus, in an English or comp lit department as I recall. She spends a semester basically being excluded from various activities by some well and less well-meaning men, such as dinner, after-dinner cigars, etc. 
- Short, about 5-6 pages
- The college is east or northeast US, I think. I do not recall whether it is identified by name. 
- A lot of use is made of the phrase ""*Hullo*, dear!"" to poke fun at the way that the men belittle the author.
- The writing is both hilarious and heart-wrenching.

I am an illustrator and lettering artist and am going to begin a lettering project called ""#ScarletLetters"". I grew up in a pretty liberal school system and was pretty much taught about a lot of 'taboo subjects' like women having a very small fertile window, masturbation is normal for girls, etc, but there was still a lot I did NOT know (crazy twisty fallopian tubes, anyone?). So with this project I want to create cool graphics that may help educate and inform others on things that may not be general knowledge. So far I have: 

Periods shouldn't be painful. If you are vomiting, passing out or writhing around like a worm from pain- you probably have endometriosis. You need to talk to a doctor. 

If you are developing hair on your chest or face, loss of scalp hair, abnormal menstruation, irregular menstruation, abnormal bleeding, weight gain, depression- talk to your doctor about PCOS. 

That [the fallopian tubes actually look](http://imgur.com/a/ofTxu) nothing like [sex ed illustrations](http://imgur.com/a/NU1b6)

That your egg dies within 24 hours of release and your fertile window is actually more likely to be 2-3 days long

I want to include the whole spectrum of taboo body topics. Like men's sperm are created 90 days before they are ejaculated. Periods are normal, bleeding is normal, and using feminine care products are normal (since there are many places that this basic fact is still taboo, and women and girls suffer from it). Girls in rural areas often miss school because of their periods due to lack of access of menstrual products. 

So, I am asking you guys- do you know of anything interesting that the general public may not realize about women's bodies? 

I might add something about female masturbation- so anyone else? Ideas about sexual/body taboos? I need a lot of ideas- so keep them coming if you can!

""A sample of 103 men in London, England, who used trafficked and non-trafficked women in prostitution were asked about their experiences and awareness of the sex industry. Almost all (96%) bought sex indoors. Many reported that they were aware of pimping, trafficking and other coercive control over those in massage parlour, brothel, and escort prostitution. These men were frequently aware of the vulnerability and risk factors for entry into prostitution including childhood abuse, lack of alternative job choices, coercive control and homelessness.""

***

Excerpt from section 5: ""Summary &amp; recommendations"":

This report has included details of the often significant knowledge held by buyers about women in prostitution, and their frank discussions of their experiences buying sex. Following are some highlights of findings from this report.

**Fifty-five per cent of 103 london men who bought sex believed that a majority of people in prostitution were lured, tricked or trafficked.**

Information and explanation of the newly introduced legislation on demand, which makes it an offence to purchase sex from someone who has been subjected to exploitation (Policing and Crime Act, 2009), should be part of public awareness campaigns aimed at reducing or eliminating men’s demand for prostitution. The law and the potential consequences of paying for sex need to be explained to current and potential buyers. In addition, general public awareness of men’s knowledge about trafficking and coercion in the sex industry is important. 

**Today, prostitution has moved indoors; 96% of these men used women in indoor prostitution (brothels, flats, saunas, massage parlours).**

Based on these 103 London men’s reports of coercive control, pimping and trafficking, it can no longer be assumed that indoor prostitution is safer than street prostitution. On the contrary, it appears that many of the most vulnerable women are kept under control indoors, not in the street where they would be seen by the public or by police. 

Local and national newspapers cannot justify selling advertising space to brothel owners and organisers of indoor prostitution. A blanket ban on advertising of this nature should be introduced.

**More than one-half of the interviewees confirmed they were in a relationship at the time they used women in prostitution. this contradicts the common misperception that men buy sex because they are lonely or have no partners.**

The disappointment expressed by men seeking the ‘girlfriend experience’ in prostitution should be highlighted in any awareness campaign. There are men who are sold the idea that ‘buying’ a partner is possible and that prostituted women can fulfil that role. 

**Many of the men felt that at various times during prostitution, women had no rights at all. Attitudes normalising rape were common among this group of men who buy sex in london. over half of the interviewees believed that men would ‘need’ to rape if they did not have access to prostituted women. **

There is no evidence supporting the theory that prostitution prevents rape. Experts in rape and other forms of sexual violence must ensure that myths that prostitution prevents rape are debunked. 

**For 29% of the men, prostitution was their first sexual experience**

The youngest interviewee was 18 years of age, confirming the need for public education programmes aimed at boys. Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education (PSHE) sessions should contain content to deter young men from becoming buyers. More than 40% of the men interviewed in this study were accompanied by friends or family the first time they bought sex. Peer pressure was a significant ‘pull factor’ for many of the men interviewed for this study. Public awareness campaigns could play an important role in primary prevention of prostitution. The ambivalence about buying sex expressed by many interviewees could be highlighted in such a campaign. 

**Legalisation and prostitution tolerance zones encouraged men to buy sex. Several men explained that once having visited areas where prostitution is legal or promoted, they returned to uk with a renewed dedication to buying sex even if that practice is illegal. **

The new UK legislation needs to be enforced extra-territorially. Almost half of the men had paid for sex in other countries, mostly in legalised regimes such as the Netherlands.

**Many men stated that pornography informed their decisions to request specific acts with women in prostitution and also with non-prostituting sex partners. other interviewees stated that pornography use led to their paying for sex.**

Further research into the connections between pornography and prostitution, particularly in relation to attitudes towards women and sexual violence, needs to be conducted in the UK.

**One-fifth of the men had paid for sex while serving in the Armed Forces.**

UK policy and deterrents like those adopted by the United Nations during the Balkan crisis are advisable.

**In England, Scotland and the U.S., men agreed that being placed on a sex offender register would most effectively deter them from buying sex. they also agreed that other deterrents such as prison time or public exposure would be effective.**

The least effective deterrent, according to interviewees in Scotland, the U.S. and London would be an educational programme without the threat of prison. An educational programme for sex buyers would be well advised to operate in conjunction with the Criminal Justice System and never as a substitute for criminal sanctions.

More than three-quarters of interviewees acknowledged that greater criminal penalties would deter them from paying for sex, and yet only 6% had ever been arrested for soliciting prostitution. New and existing legislation needs to be vigorously implemented. A public awareness campaign to accompany enforcement of laws against buying sex might be modelled on the 2006 anti-smoking campaign.

**Of 103 london men who had bought sex, two-thirds said that being issued an ASBo  (anti-social behavior order) would be a deterrent.**

Currently in London, ASBOs are routinely issued to women in street prostitution but rarely to men apprehended as kerb crawlers.  Such measures need to be used against buyers.

**Sixty-five per cent of interviewees believed that ‘most men pay for sex.’**

General public education and awareness campaigns are essential in challenging men’s demand for prostitution. An approach to public education about prostitution would be to emphasise the marginalised status of men who buy sex rather than viewing their activity as part of the mainstream.

**Most men (71%) said they felt ambivalence about paying for sex.  they often felt guilt or shame about buying sex while at the same time continuing to use prostituted women, hiding those behaviours.**

The men avoided emotional involvement with women in prostitution while at the same time seeking the appearance of a relationship. Lacking accurate empathy with the objects of their sexual purchase, the men were usually unable to determine what the women actually thought or felt, including the women’s lack of genuine sexual interest. 

Men’s ambivalence about prostitution might serve as a point of entry to educational programmes that promote sustained deterrence from buying sex.

Some men said they were unable to imagine a world in which prostitution could ever be ended. When asked what they thought might bring about an end to the sex trade, responses such as, “kill every girl in the world,” and “you’d need to put all men in solitary cells” highlighted the fact that for many, prostitution is viewed as an inevitability. Others could see possibilities for change. “The challenge,” said one interviewee, “is to change the way men think.”

Men’s attitudes play a central role in perpetrating violence against women. Efforts to prevent violence against women must address not only those attitudes which are overtly condoning of violence against women, but also the wider clusters of attitudes related to sex, including prostitution, which normalise and justify this violence (Flood and Pease, 2009). 

A majority of these men were aware of specific instances of trafficking for prostitution. Often, they knew that they were using trafficked women for sex. Trafficking is associated with brothel and massage parlour prostitution in UK. Trafficking victims from Brazil, Lithuania and Thailand were discovered at a 2009 Reading brothel raid (Roberts, 2009). Traffickers have the capacity to hide human trafficking in the huge volume of travel facilitated by globalisation. They can also neutralise or overcome regulatory measures imposed by governments through corruption and co-option (Williams, 2009). Organised criminals who traffic women to London for prostitution have the capacity to rapidly modify trafficking operations to reflect changing risks, to forge high quality documents; to use front companies; to use advanced technology such as satellite phones, GPS, and digital surveillance; to use defence lawyers who are skilled at defending organised criminals; and to launder funds from trafficking via sophisticated methods (Picarelli, 2009).

 

Specifically referring to the goal of ending sex trafficking, in late 2009, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for greater efforts to tackle the global pandemic of violence against women and girls, emphasising that the international community must demand accountability and take concrete steps to end impunity (UN News Centre, 2009).  Since it is known that prostitution is associated with extremely high levels of violence against women (Watts and Zimmerman, 2002), and based on this study it is known that many of the men who buy prostituted women are aware of the crimes of pimping, coercive control, lack of opportunity for escape and trafficking, the next logical step would be to move forward with stronger legal and social deterrents for the sex buyer.

I've already posted this but...I feel lost. 


To cut an exceptionally long story short, a sober guy (well, he said he had had 'a beer and a few puffs of weed') had sex with me while I was extremely, extremely drunk - i.e, 1.5 bottles of wine, 5-6 vodka shots and a few cans, all consumed within the space of two hours.


To go on: I don't remember how I ended up at his. X said his friend found me wandering around outside looking out of it, so brought me back to the common room (we live in dorms; and this is all his narrative). X took me back to his flat because I looked so out of it to 'take care of me' - he gave me bread and water, and helped me be sick when I said I felt ill. He said I then came onto him when we were both in the bathroom (I was laying on the floor, resting my head on his knee) and apparently I 'made a move'. I then asked him for a condom, apparently, so he went and got one; when he came back i was still on the floor, so he took me to the bed and undressed me. He then said he gave me oral, and I gave him oral afterwards - i do remember about three seconds of giving him a BJ, but I don't remember thinking anything at all: I didnt' even feel like I was in my own body. I remember him telling me something, and I just did it. Then he said we had sex - I remember laying on my back, asking if he had a condom on, and him parting my legs and just entering me (to be graphic).I then remember sort of putting my hands on his chest because the pressure was quite great, but nothing of the sex after that, which apparently went on for 'ten minutes'. He told my friend, who went to speak to him afterwards (as I fell asleep on her sofa) that I 'changed my mind' so he stopped; but he told me it was taking too long so he just wanted to wank himself off to finish so he could continue 'taking care of me'. I then remember trying to leave - he said I was half-naked - and he was naked, standing in front of me, and I think I tried to get past him? But he stopped me, and i don't remember anything else. He said he had to help dress me, and he had to 'get me on his side' before I went to find my friends. Then, when I found my friends, apparently all I was saying was 'he was too strong and I couldn't get him off me'. I don't remember saying this, nor do I know why I would...


I asked the guy why he did it, he said he didnt' really think and he hadn't had sex in 2-3 weeks so it 'altered his thinking' a bit - he said he thought I was consenting, that I seemed 'alright' during sex, that he only realised he 'fucked up' afterwards. I don't know what to think, to be honest. Maybe he's exaggerating with how lucid I was, because my friends said I could barely speak or walk when they found me afterwards, and my eyes were like rolling back - and that was an hour later.


I don't think is rape, but I'm not sure what it is. I don't know if I consented - maybe I did, but something panicked me at least? Maybe the fact that I slept with a stranger, when it's not something I'd usually do, caused me to attempt to shift the blame to him? I'd feel disgusting, if so. I wouldn't report him because I don't think he's malicious, but...I don't know whether i'm right to feel so upset about it.


Sorry about the awful writing, I wanted to get the bare-bones down without purple prose getting in the way.


And yeah, I know drinking to that extent was stupid. I was supposed to stick with friends, and I was in my own room for ages, but we all got split up because other people got really drunk and had to be taken to bed, etc. I must have wandered off, idk. I haven't ever been that drunk since, nor will I ever again.

I am NOT saying there is no such thing as gender. Gender has been constructed! I am a girl and I like being one! Trans people exist because they have been assigned the wrong gender, which totally exists even if I don't think it really should.

I am saying that gender is becoming more fluid. We constructed it and are changing it in many ways. Because of this, I think it makes sense for us to be talking about gender because what we feel we are is probably changing with definitions.

I am NOT saying this as an attack against trans folk or queer folk or anyone. I'm saying this because I, as a woman and feminist and human etc, want to understand what gender means.

I am saying sex is real. I've read from people that sex is on a ""spectrum"" and like... at best it's not entirely binary, but sex was assigned at birth. Most of us are male or female at birth. And that's okay, it doesn't have to control our gender, though I'm sure it impacts it, at least in our society.

I am NOT saying trans folk shouldn't have surgery to transition, but man... I would really like for us to conflate sex and gender less. I don't have a full understanding of the link between sex and gender for a trans person, because I'm cis, but it seems to me it would be great if trans people didn't feel the need to transition. Perhaps they would always want to transition and my view is regressive, but I think my thought process for it is pretty logical.

During the times we were friends I have remained in a relationship, I was never available. Once upon a time he told me that he 'loved' me and was trying to come to terms with it. He was actively spying my activity in facebook and WhatsApp. Whenever I was online he would bombard me with messages, links, and romantic country songs (/me = pukes). I kept telling him that I could NOT be anything more than a friend to him and all. However he remained *apparently* a good friend until recently, like he didnt *care about not dating me, because our friendship was more importan*. I decided to keep him as a friend and not taking things very personally and that he just had a sticky nature. He was *acting* like a good friend and had this ""I will always be there for you"" kind of attitude. Mind you that I am an aloof person and I hate when random people touch me. I was raped and I have PTSD [and btw HE damn well KNEW THIS] .
The PTSD attacks will be triggered if people touch with the exception of romantic partners and greeting gestures (hello and goodbye hugs, handshakes etc), however this guy became uncomfortably pushy with time and would touch my hand in a very weird way and I was really uncomfortable​ with this, but I wanted to be polite so I tolerated it. Once, he attempted to touch my face after touching my hand in a very weird way and I was barely tolerating it so I took my hand away, he threatened to leave, i felt honestly guilty and said ""nah it's okay"" i shoukd have told him to fuck off. He interpreted this in whatever twisted way he wanted in his head and he lifted his hand to touch my cheek and I said ""Don't!"". I had enough of it. He immediately got up, pissed off and said he should go home. I brought him to the door at some point he said ""I love you"" kinda expecting something back. I was disturbed and feeling betrayed. When i questioned him about *why did you touch me if you KNOW I dont react well to it* and that it gave me flashbacks all night. He told me to *fuck off* [NOTE HERE that suddenly *He* is the victim]  and said that, I could not continue my friendship with him, if he would not respect my right to not want to be touched specially as somebody with my history. Also that nothing between us would ever happen. He still wanted to be my friend but the fact that he could never touch me again and that I shut him down yet again, means for him that our friendship is worthless, he was only my friend while I tolerated his subtle invasions. He cannot accept me for who I am and obviously doesn't like being denied intimacy rights over my body, he doesnt respect me at all. It's my fucking body and you don't need to touch me to be my friend. I haven't had this problem with ANYONE else. Everybody else seems perfectly fine respecting my wish to not be poked at. The best part is that in no time his *apparent friendliness* disappeared completely. He treats me like a stranger now. The 6 years of friendship of him pretending to care DISAPPEARED instantly. Yeah, I feel used and betrayed but, on the other hand I feel liberated that I will never have to put up with his abusive and rapey ways anymore. I'm disgusted and honestly feel like I could punch him in the face for being such a nasty fucking creep, who was getting off on touching me/flirting, despite of me saying that I didn't like it and that it triggered my PTSD. Honestly, what kind of human being would like to give someone PTSD flashbacks... to hell with this kind of people. I don't understand it. And this just comfirms even more how some men can only value women if they feel like they can have a chance of sticking their dicks in us. After a while feeling bad, I feel liberated.

**Abstract**


This chapter develops an alternative for (what feminists call) “the sex/gender distinction”. I do so in order to avoid certain problematic implications the distinction underpins. First, the sex/gender distinction paradigmatically holds that some social conditions determine one’s gender (whether one is a woman or a man), and that some biological conditions determine one’s sex (whether one is female or male). Further, sex and gender come apart. Taking gender as socially constructed, this implies that women exist mind-dependently, or due to productive human social activities; thus, it should be possible to do away with them just by altering the social conditions on which gender depends. In addition, some feminists take gender to depend on oppressive social conditions. Changing our social environments, then, would not only unwittingly eradicate women; doing away with women should be feminism’s political goal. I argue that both implications are unacceptable. In response, I argue for a view that is more congenial to ordinary thinking and that doesn’t have the goal of eradicating women.

**Introduction**

This chapter develops a model, which I will call “the trait/norm covariance model”, as an alternative for understanding the phenomena feminists usually discuss under the rubric of the sex/gender distinction. This well-known distinction gives rise to certain problems that motivate the formulation of my alternative model. Specifically, I have in mind here problems arising from the conventionalist and abolitionist implications that the distinction underpins. First, consider the conventionalist implications: paradigmatically, some social conditions must be met in order for one to count as a woman or a man because gender is (as the slogan goes) socially constructed. One need not satisfy any biological or anatomical conditions; they are relevant only for counting as female or male. On this understanding “woman” and “man” are used as gender terms, “female” and “male” as sex terms.  The implication is that women and men exist mind-dependently or due to productive human social activities: that there are women and men ontologically depends on some social institutions and agents, their beliefs, practices and/or conventions in that women and men could not exist unless the relevant institutions, practices and conventions (with conscious agents upholding them) existed. Women and men are akin to wives, husbands and US senators that also depend on us for their existence.  This being so, it should be possible to do away with women and men while leaving the individuals we call “women” and “men” otherwise intact–we simply alter those social conditions on which gender depends so that individuals no longer count as women and men. Consider a parallel to US senators: their existence depends on certain sociopolitical conventions so that were a political revolution to alter those conventions by abolishing the US Senate, US senators would literally vanish overnight. Those individuals who previously counted as US senators would no longer do so despite being otherwise physically intact (presuming the revolution were a bloodless one). Just as one need not execute US senators in order to eradicate them, the thought is, eradicating women and men does not require physically altering those individuals we think of as women and men. Second, consider the abolitionist implication: in addition to holding a conventionalist view, some feminists take gender to depend ontologically on oppressive social conditions. As a result, changing our social environments would not only unwittingly eradicate women and men: doing away with gender should be feminism’s political goal.  


As I see it, both implications are problematic and ones that many ordinary social agents are unwilling to accept. Ordinarily, women are thought to be human females, men human males. As a result, their existence is not thought to depend on productive human social conventions, practices and institutions so that we could abolish women and men leaving intact females and males simply by altering our social landscapes. Conventionalist implications, then, are unintuitive. Further, ordinary social agents often find the abolitionist implication that “after the revolution” women and men will no longer exist objectionable. Many of my students, along with other feminist philosophers, do not see being a woman or a man as problematic per se. Rather, the problem is how we are viewed and treated as women and men. For ordinary thinking, then, the idea that feminists should aim to do away with women and men harbors undesirable ontological commitments.

These problems are generated by a clash between the paradigmatic feminist and everyday conceptions of sex and gender. Ordinary thinking does not separate sex and gender in the way many feminists do, thus neither seeing the existence of women and men as mind-dependent nor holding that gender is something to be eradicated. We can avoid this clash in one of two ways: either feminists work hard to modify everyday conceptions of sex and gender so that they are in line with the conventionalist and abolitionist views, or feminists modify their conceptions of sex and gender so that they are closer to everyday thinking. Here I will endorse the latter option and propose a way to conceptualize the phenomena usually discussed under the sex/gender distinction to avoid the unintuitive and undesirable ontological commitments. I will do so by developing what I will call “the trait/norm covariance model” to replace the usual sex/gender distinction. My alternative model will involve redrawing the boundaries of the sets of gender and sex traits and dividing these traits into new sets: descriptive traits (traits of which there is “a fact of the matter”) and evaluative norms (norms that express judgments about descriptive traits). For instance, the paradigmatic gender trait of wearing make-up and the paradigmatic sex trait of having ovaries will both count as descriptive traits (one either has ovaries/regularly wears make-up or not). But, my model also acknowledges the influence of social norms: certain evaluations (like being judged to act, be or appear “feminine”) can be seen to covary with particular descriptive traits, which accounts for why some traits are supposedly appropriate for women and others for men.4

By way of illustration, I will consider Sally Haslanger’s fascinating and innovative recent account of gender (“Gender and Race”; “Future Genders”; “Social Construction”), which has the conventionalist and abolitionist implications. Next, I will examine what precisely is problematic about these implications in order to motivate my alternative model. I will then outline my trait/norm covariance model, ending with a discussion of how it avoids the problematic ontological commitments considered.

**Haslanger on Gender: An Example**

Haslanger’s account of gender has conventionalist and abolitionist implications: it takes the existence of women and men to be mind-dependent in the sense of depending on human social practices and conventions, and it takes these conventions and practices to be oppressive—for her, since gender is a product of oppressive social forces feminists should aim to eradicate it. These implications are underpinned by a distinction between sex and gender that many feminists have historically endorsed. Paradigmatically: “sex” denotes human females and males depending on some biological features (like chromosomes, sex organs, hormones or other physical features to do with reproduction) whereas “gender” denotes women and men depending on some social factors (like social role, position, behaviour or identity). As is well known, the motivation for drawing the sex/gender distinction was to counter biological determinism that took some (supposedly) biological facts to explain behavioural and psychological differences between women and men. Instead, feminists argued that these differences have social causes. They distinguished biological and social/psychological differences and began using the term “gender” to denote the latter. For instance, Gayle Rubin (who was one of the first feminists to articulate this distinction) used the phrase “sex/gender system” in order to describe “a set of arrangements by which the biological raw material of human sex and procreation is shaped by human, social intervention” (165). For Rubin, although sex differences are fixed, gender differences are the oppressive results of social interventions that dictate how women and men should behave: women are oppressed as women and “by having to be women” (204). For her, gender is the social interpretation of sex and an oppressive one at that. However, women’s oppression is mutable by political and social reform that abolishes gender. As Rubin saw it, feminism should aim to create a “genderless (though not sexless) society, in which one’s sexual anatomy is irrelevant to who one is, what one does, and with whom one makes love” (204).

For Haslanger, gender is constitutively constructed: in defining it we must make reference to social factors (“Ontology and Social Construction” 98), and, in particular, we must make reference to unequal social positions (“Gender and Race” 37–43). In so doing, Haslanger aims to debunk the ordinary view that gender classification is a matter of anatomy. Commonly, being female is thought to be sufficient for womanhood; Haslanger, on the other hand, takes the conditions for satisfying “woman” to be social rather than biological. Her project involves showing that although the use of the term “woman” is thought to track a group of “individuals defined by a set of physical ... conditions [it] is better understood as capturing a group that occupies a certain ... social position” (“Social Construction” 318). And the social positions that our gendered classification scheme tracks and that make gender ascriptions apt crucially involve reference to subordination and privilege. For Haslanger, societies in general tend to “privilege individuals with male bodies” (“Gender and Race” 38) so that the social positions they subsequently occupy are better than the social positions of those with female bodies. And this generates sexist injustices. For her:

&gt;S is a woman if [by definition] S is systematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, political, legal, social, etc.), and S is “marked” as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female’s biological role in reproduction.

&gt;S is a man if [by definition] S is systematically privileged along some dimension (economic, political, legal, social, etc.), and S is “marked” as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a male’s biological role in reproduction (“Future Genders” 6–7).

These are constitutive of being a woman or a man: what makes calling S a woman apt is not that S is female, but that S is oppressed on sex-marked grounds; what makes calling S a man apt is not that S is male, but that S is privileged on sex-marked grounds.

Haslanger acknowledges that debunking projects like hers sometimes require a “radical change in our thinking” (“Social Construction” 319). After all, her proposal is counterintuitive: privileged females like, arguably, the Queen of England would not count as women on this view. But Haslanger’s project does not aim to capture what ordinary language users intuitively have in mind and her aim is not to illuminate our commonsense understandings of gender terms. Haslanger’s analysis is, in her terms, ameliorative: it aims to elucidate which gender concepts best help feminists achieve their legitimate purposes thereby elucidating those concepts feminists should be using (“Gender and Race” 33).  That is, endorsing her classification scheme is a pragmatic political choice. And (Haslanger holds) feminists should choose her account of gender since it will be helpful in feminist fights against sexist injustices enabling feminists to identify and explain persistent inequalities between women and men in terms of their social positions. Insofar as Haslanger takes being a woman to be a social matter crucially tied to oppression, she holds that “it is part of the project of feminism to bring about a day when there are no more women (though, of course, we should not aim to do away with females!)” (“Gender and Race” 46). Since what it is to be a woman is by definition tied to sexist oppression, gender justice would eradicate women by abolishing those social structures that are responsible for sex-marked oppression. Women and men could not exist, unless sexist oppression existed; that women and men exist is mind-dependent being the result of oppressive human social activities. And feminism’s goal should be to dismantle those social structures responsible for gender and, by extension, women and men.

Problems with the Conventionalist and Abolitionist Implications

Earlier I claimed that ordinary thinking finds the conventionalist and abolitionist implications of accounts like Haslanger’s problematic. I also claimed that these problems are underpinned by a clash between different conceptions of sex and gender. Let’s examine the worries in more detail.

The Conventionalist View Is Unintuitive

For Haslanger (among others) gender depends on something social and not on anything biological. This prima facie makes being a woman ontologically on a par with being a US senator, a wife or a landlord. And, it seems, just as one can cease to be a wife by changing one’s social relations (by getting a divorce), one should be able to cease to be a woman by changing those social relations constitutive of womanhood. But a closer examination suggests that being a woman is not ontologically on a par with (say) being a wife. To tease this out, consider the following claims:

(1)	For a week last summer, James was a woman.

(2)	For a week last summer, James was a US senator.

These statements take “woman” and “US senator” as social notions. The first takes womanhood to be about easily perceptible gender markers like clothing and appearance (James lived “as a woman” for a week last summer). The second takes James to have been treated in ways that enabled him to count as a US senator for a week (for instance, James was elected to the US Senate, but due to a political scandal lost his position very quickly). Now, consider:

(3)	After seeing John’s body, I realised that John is a woman.

(4)	After seeing John’s body, I realised that John is a US senator.

These claims are not about social factors. We can understand claim (3) and it makes sense to us, although we are clearly using “woman” as a biological term. However, when we substitute “woman” for “US senator” in (4), the statement no longer makes sense to us. After all, just by looking at one’s body, it’s not possible to know that one is a US senator. That is, when used as a social term, “woman” is on a par with “US senator”. But we can also use “woman” as a biological term, which makes “woman” and “US senator” come apart. The upshot of this is that “woman” is not a purely social term ; for ordinary thinking, then, being a woman is not on a par ontologically with what it is to be a member of some other social kind. And this suggests that it is not obviously true that women and men’s existence is minddependent in that one can cease to be a woman (or a man) just by altering one’s social environment. Because ordinary thinking does not see being a woman as a purely social matter, conventionalist implications (like the implication that we can eradicate women and men via change in our social environments) are hard to accept. The paradigmatic feminist distinction between sex and gender clashes with everyday thinking. Due to this, ordinary thinking doubts the possibility of eradicating gender via social change, because it ties sex and gender together.

A defender of the conventionalist view might hold that claim (3) doesn’t really make sense either, but we are fooled into believing that it does precisely because ordinary thinking ties sex and gender together when it shouldn’t. So, if we thought about womanhood in the right way, we would see that (3) is also senseless. That would leave claim (1) where “woman” is a social notion making it akin to “US senator”. My worries about unintuitive ontological commitments are dispelled prima facie making it possible for one to cease to be a woman just by altering one’s social environment. But this raises some further questions that the defender of the conventionalist view must answer: Precisely what kind of social change would abolish women and men? Which beliefs, social conventions, linguistic practices and relations would have to be altered for one to no longer count as a woman or a man? And which social institutions, relations and structures would have to be dismantled so that women and men were to cease to exist wholesale? These questions cannot be answered in any intuitively obvious introspective manner. In fact, answering them is the stuff of feminist philosophy and a huge point of contention. Admittedly, this contention may be generated by gender being such an incredibly complex phenomenon that discerning the kind of social change that would eradicate it is extremely difficult; we may simply be ignorant of the kind of change needed, but it is possible to eradicate gender via social change. This may be so. But it may also be that feminists cannot agree on what social changes would do away with women and men because doing so just by altering one’s social environment is not possible. Bluntly put, perhaps it is just plain wrong to think that women and men’s existence ontologically depends on some social factors. I am not concluding that it is; I am merely making a strategic point. The issue of, on which social conditions the existence of women and men depends, is so intractable as to be unhelpful. If gender really is such a complex issue that it is hugely difficult (if not impossible) to articulate and agree on what sort of social change would eradicate it, the most useful move would seem to be to give up the quest. Pragmatically, feminists should not try to uncover which social factors are responsible for the existence of women and men, but, instead, should settle for the much less contentious view that human actions significantly shape the way we are as women and men. No feminist (to the best of my knowledge) denies this claim. The concerns I have raised here are not decisive and do not rule out conventionalism about gender altogether. But, as I see it, the less contentious view I have floated here is the one that feminists ought to endorse precisely because of its less contentious commitments. 

**The Abolitionist Implication Is Undesirable**

On views like Haslanger’s, gender is also a product of oppressive social conditions and, thus, something feminists should seek to abolish. But this abolitionist view may not be conducive to feminist interests since for ordinary thinking it harbours undesirable ontological commitments. To tease this out, contrast such abolitionist strategies with a different (what I will call) “re-evaluative” strategy. They both have the same starting point: feminism is about ending oppression that women as women face. But their ways of achieving this goal differ, which alters the strategies’ outcomes. Abolitionist accounts take womanhood to be by definition tied to oppression so that it is not possible to be a woman and not be (in some sense) oppressed. Reevaluative accounts do not take being a woman to be per se oppressive. Instead, they recognise that our social circumstances create environments where women are viewed and treated in ways that disadvantage them, perhaps by associating some traits with women and using this association to justify disadvantageous treatment. Nonetheless, by altering how women are viewed and treated it is possible to be a woman and yet not be oppressed. So, on the former view, gender justice would dismantle unjust social hierarchies thus doing away with women and men; on the latter, it would dismantle such hierarchies while retaining women and men (roughly) in a re-evaluated sense.

The strategy to follow comes down to a pragmatic political choice. But if ordinary social agents think that eradicating gender is undesirable, it may be strategically wrongheaded to endorse an account of gender that has abolitionist implications. Some anecdotal evidence supports this: my feminism students tell me time and again that they think the abolitionist strategy is aiming to eradicate something that need not be eradicated—the “feminist revolution” need not do away with gender and doing so would result in (at least some) good being unnecessarily lost. Many insist that the ways in which people are treated as woman and men is the problem feminists should focus on—being a woman or a man is not primarily the problem. And many claim to find their gender a source of positive value. After all, it is certainly true that, although one may be discriminated against due to one’s gender, it can still be something one values positively; in a similar sense, one can take pride in one’s racial group membership despite being socially disadvantaged by it. The everyday conception of gender clashes with feminist conceptions like Haslanger’s. As a result, ordinary thinking doubts the viability of eradicating gender because it sees gender as being at least partly a positive social identity rather than being a wholly negative one.

Projects like Haslanger’s do, of course, start by aiming to alter the ways in which we are viewed and treated as women and men. So, in a sense, the abolitionist and re-evaluative routes go hand-in-hand to begin with. But the abolitionist strategy runs into difficulties if many social agents are unwilling to follow it through. Haslanger is asking for a significant shift in people’s self-conceptions and acknowledges that she is asking social agents to understand themselves in ways that are not ordinarily part of their gendered self-understandings (“Gender and Race” 48). In so doing, she is “call[ing] upon us to reject what seemed to be positive social identities” and to refuse to be gendered women and men (“Gender and Race” 48). I agree with Haslanger that a change in our self-understandings is called for; but I wonder if the change that she is calling for is the right kind of change given that ordinary thinking does not see the viability of eradicating gender. Again, my point is strategic: accounts that have abolitionist implications are likely to be extremely demanding. It will take a lot of convincing to make ordinary social agents view their gender as not being even in part a positive social identity and to make them refuse to be gendered women and men, if social agents do not believe to begin with that this is necessary. And, one might wonder, whether scarce feminist resources should be directed at something other than trying to convince social agents to revise their self-understandings in this manner.

Fortunately my students always do express a desire to see an end to gendered oppression. And clearly this is what Haslanger also wants, which may suggest that really the parties to the debate are just talking past each other. Everyone wants the same thing: gender justice. Haslanger’s rhetoric just differs from how we ordinarily talk about women and men. Usually, acknowledging this does not dispel my students’ worries; they still find it puzzling that Haslanger doesn’t use gender terms as people ordinarily do and wonder why she is confusing matters with her conception of gender. Of course, Haslanger’s rhetoric has a specific, valuable purpose: to motivate a certain kind of social and political response that undermines sexist oppression. But, given the kinds of worries I have mentioned here, strategically I think that this kind of response can be better motivated by understanding the phenomena feminists discuss under the rubric of sex and gender in a way that does not imply women and men no longer exist “after the revolution”. The worry is that accounts with abolitionist implications probably would not motivate positive social change, if this change requires that social agents must give up something they do not want to give up.

**The Trait/Norm Covariance Model**

This section develops my trait/norm covariance model as an alternative to the sex/gender distinction. To begin with, it is important to note that, contrary to traditional feminist views, I do not take the term “woman” to be a purely social gender term. Ordinary speakers have, to use Ron Mallon’s terminology, indicative features in mind when they call someone a “woman”:

&gt;there is a distinction between those properties that are indicative of category membership (such as easily perceptible racial [or gender] markers), and those that are central. A property is indicative of category membership if having the property increases the likelihood that one is a member of a category. In the United States wearing a dress is indicative of being a woman ... [But w]earing a dress is neither necessary nor sufficient for being a woman.

(652–3)

Indicative features of womanhood include one’s appearance (clothing, hairstyles, make-up); behavioural patterns; social roles; and anatomical and bodily features (body type, shape, size, amount of body hair and how one “carries” one’s body). These features are conceivably involved in everyday gender ascriptions. Paradigmatically, feminists hold that the indicative features mentioned are not exclusively gender traits in that they include features which are taken to be paradigmatic sex traits (to do with being female or male). But, ordinary language users often deploy “woman” on the basis of anatomical sex features such as body type; “woman” is not a purely gender term for them, but (bluntly put) a mixture of sex and gender. So, ordinarily “woman” denotes individuals who are taken to possess features indicative of womanhood. This does not (and certainly should not) limit the application of “woman” to women-born-female; the term also applies to trans women, individuals “assigned male at birth whose gender presentation may be construed as ‘unambiguously’ female” (Bettcher 46), who call themselves “women”.

My contention is that feminists should use the term “woman” as ordinarily as possible. And the trait/norm covariance model that I will outline next will be sensitive to these reflections about ordinary language use. The model I am proposing deals roughly with the same phenomena that the sex/gender distinction does. It just understands that phenomena in a different way that is, I submit, more fruitful in being more congenial to everyday thinking. On my view, we redraw the boundaries of the sets of gender traits and sex traits giving up the labels “sex” and “gender” to denote those traits. Instead, the traits are divided into sets of descriptive traits and evaluative norms. The former (in a sense) describe “the way the world is” and include physical and anatomical traits (e.g., chromosomes, ovaries, testes, genitalia, body shape and size), one’s appearance (e.g., one’s clothing, make-up, haircut, amount of body hair), roles (e.g., whether one undertakes caretaking roles, engages in childrearing tasks) and self-conceptions (calling oneself a woman or a man). These are features of which there are “facts of the matter”—it isn’t in any sense mysterious or down to value judgements whether one has ovaries, undertakes childrearing tasks, or calls oneself a woman. (This does not mean that values were not involved in singling out descriptive features, like anatomical traits, or that descriptive features are not socially malleable; but more on this shortly.) Evaluative norms are to do with stereotypical judgements: whether one is judged to be, to appear to be and/or to act in ”feminine”, ”masculine” or “neutral” ways. Evaluative norms attributed reflect value judgements and cultural norms. So, on my and the paradigmatic feminist schemas:

 Paradigmatic feministmodel|.. |Trait/normcovariancemodel | ..
--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------
Sex	               |Gender                 |Descriptive traits	   |Evaluative norms
Having ovaries	|Wearing make-up |Having ovaries	           |Being “feminine”
	                |Being “feminine”   |Wearing make-up	|

What does it mean to say that evaluative norms covary with descriptive traits? Just that we take certain traits to be of certain kind. So, the trait/norm covariance relation is constituted by particular descriptive traits being viewed in a particular manner by us. I take “femininity” to mean “associated with women”, “masculinity” to mean “associated with men” and “neutrality” to mean “associated with neither or both”. That is, depending on how we view particular descriptive traits, they either covary with femininity, masculinity or neutrality. And certain trait/norm pairings are currently linked to women, others to men and still others to neither or both. They can be so linked in a global or (more often than not) in a local manner. For instance, being short-sighted is globally neutral: as far as I know, the trait is nowhere associated exclusively with either women or men thereby globally covarying with neutrality. Then again, possession of testes appears to be globally masculine, possession of ovaries globally feminine. Quite often, though, the trait/norm pairings are local differing from one context to the next and depending on social and cultural factors. So, although all cultures have traits that covary with femininity and others that covary with masculinity, the configurations of these trait/norm pairings can differ depending on their location. To illustrate, take long hair. In many UK communities it is no longer strongly associated with women and often covaries with neutrality. However, in UK Asian-Indian communities that do not consider it appropriate for those picked out by “woman” to have short hair, having long hair covaries more strongly with femininity. But, of course, other social and cultural axes affect this covariance relation even within a culture: in many UK Indian Sikh contexts, neither men nor women are expected to cut their hair, which suggests that (in these social contexts) having long hair covaries with neutrality. However, in these contexts, other practices to do with hair covary with femininity and masculinity, like the practice of Sikh men wearing turbans. The trait/norm pairings are interrelated: with those picked out by “man”, the pairing “having long hair/neutrality” is interrelated with “wearing a turban/masculinity”; but for those picked out by “woman” the former pairing is not interrelated with the latter pairing. (For more on Asian social conventions to do with hair, see Hiltebeitel and Miller.) The trait/norm covariance relations can also change over time. Wearing trousers is a good example: until quite recently in many Western Anglo-European contexts, masculinity covaried with it. But, relatively quickly, in many contexts it has become neutral. It is now socially acceptable for someone ordinarily picked out by “woman” to wear trousers. The same social value is no longer attached to this trait. Of course, this all further demonstrates that the ways in which the trait/norm covariance relations pan out are not always straightforward. Since the relations depend on beliefs and conventions that change over time and place, they will usually be manifestations of some local and contextspecific beliefs and conventions. There are many complications not least because of differences in contexts and in what norms social agents project on descriptive traits. Nevertheless, it seems fair to say that sometimes seeing how the relations pan out is not complicated and that sometimes social agents do not differ significantly in their ascriptions of norms.

I have said that certain descriptive traits covary with certain evaluative norms, but what explains this covariance relation? I take the existence of this relation to be a thoroughly mind-dependent matter. If you like, wearing make-up and engaging in child-care (to name two descriptive traits) are not inherently or mind-independently feminine–that femininity covaries with them is something that depends for its existence on social factors and obtains because of us. The classification scheme of feminine, masculine and neutral evaluative norms is a strong pragmatic construction; that is, social factors wholly determine our use of the scheme and the scheme fails to represent accurately any “facts of the matter” (Haslanger, “Ontology and Social Construction” 100). So, the classification scheme does not pick out any mind-independent facts about descriptive traits. That some traits are viewed as feminine, masculine or neutral is a consequence of “human-made” fashions, styles, cultural beliefs, social conventions and linguistic practices, which determine what features are judged to be of what kind. The classification scheme of feminine/masculine/neutral is a mere social construction. Furthermore, this scheme tends to be hierarchal in grading traits; this is evident from the devaluing of many activities and features with which femininity covaries (like the devaluing of caretaking work).

On my model the claim “Jane is feminine because Jane wears make-up” does not capture any mind-independent fact about the world. Yet, my model also takes wearing make-up to be a descriptive trait of which there is “a fact of the matter”. So, it appears that saying Jane wears make-up does capture something mind-independent about the world. It is worth clarifying the notion of mind-independence here to avoid an air of inconsistency. Consider driving. In the United Kingdom, people drive on the left-hand side of the road; in the United States, they drive on the right. Which convention is the correct or true one? We cannot say because the context-specific conventions that govern driving are mind-dependent: they depend for their existence on productive human social practices and require that certain human-made background conditions are in place. Such conventions are, of course, mutable. The UK government could just decide to alter conventions governing driving. Obviously doing so in practice would be hugely difficult and certainly no easy feat. But the point is that ultimately conventions come down to us—there is no mind-independent fact about which side of the road is the correct side for driving. However, that people drive on the left in the United Kingdom is mind-independent in another sense. When I state “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left” I am stating something that is true mind-independently: the truth of the statement is not (if you like) up for grabs. I cannot just decide that the statement is false and drive on the right. (Or, I could, but probably with quite tragic results.) So, given certain background conditions, it is a mind-independent fact that in the United Kingdom people drive on the left irrespective of the fact that the convention to drive on the left is minddependent.

The descriptive trait of wearing make-up is akin to the convention of driving on the left: it is mind-dependent in that it is a trait that depends for its existence on particular human-made social conditions (it requires that certain human-made background conditions are in place). The trait is also socially mutable: wearing make-up might, for example, go out of fashion thus prompting people to abandon the practice. Nonetheless, that Jane wears make-up is (in another sense) mind-independent. The truth or falsity of the statement “Jane wears make-up” is not up for grabs: either she does or she doesn’t. This is akin to the claim “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left”: however mind-dependent—due to productive human activities— the respective conventions (to drive on the left and to wear make-up) are, whether the statements “Jane wears make-up” and “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left” are true or false is not open to debate given our current conventions. By contrast, the claim “The convention to drive on the left is better than the convention to drive on the right” is utterly mind-dependent. Whether this statement is thought to be true or false depends on one’s view or opinion, in addition to the convention to drive on the left being a product of human social practices. 

Now, although it is a mind-independent feature of reality that Jane wears makeup, that Jane acts in a feminine way because she wears make-up is mind-dependent. It does not capture any mind-independent facts about the world, like some supposed fact that the practice of wearing make-up is inherently feminine. That femininity covaries with wearing make-up is mind-dependent obtaining due to productive human activities—because of us. This further illustrates that the trait/norm covariance relation is not a causal relation in the sense that the former causes the latter.

Childcare activities or the practice of wearing make-up do not cause femininity to covary with them; rather, our beliefs and judgements cause this. To illustrate, think about morality. Standardly moral philosophers agree that the act of giving to charity covaries with moral goodness. But does the act cause moral goodness? This depends on one’s metaethical commitments. For some moral realists, the answer might be yes: the act of giving to charity instantiates a realist (non-natural) moral property of goodness. So, the act of giving to charity literally causes moral goodness to pop up in the world because one’s actions instantiate the property of goodness. For moral constructivists, however, the answer might be no: the act of giving to charity covaries with moral goodness because we project moral goodness onto the act of giving to charity. Roughly, we have constructed a moral world in which giving to charity is considered good. So, the relation between giving to charity and moral goodness is not a causal one in that the former causes the latter. That giving to charity is considered to be morally good is down to us. The same appears to be true of what I have said about descriptive traits and evaluative norms: we have constructed a gendered world in which childcare and wearing make-up are considered to be feminine. That is, we— human social agents—are responsible for these covariance relations. And this being fortunately the case, we can also alter them so that childcare, for instance, no longer covaries with femininity.

Anytime my sister disagrees with me, she brings up the fact that I'm a feminist and mocks me for it. 

I told my sister she was dumb for not being a feminist. I know that's probably not the best way to go about it, but what other way is there? I struggle with always insisting that I'm right, and I recognize that, but it's hard for me to avoid belittling people who are so blatantly wrong in my mind.

**Abstract**

In this chapter I distinguish among different theories of gender essentialism and sketch out a taxonomy of gender essentialisms. I focus primarily on the difference between essentialism about a kind and essentialism about an individual. I propose that there is an interesting and useful form of gender essentialism that pertains to social individuals. And I argue that this form of gender essentialism, which I call uniessentialism, is not vulnerable to standard, feminist criticisms of gender essentialism.

&gt;But the human essence is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In its reality it is the ensemble of social relations. (Karl Marx, Theses on Feuerbach, VI)

&gt;The only dependable test for gender is the truth of a person’s life, the lives we live each day.

(Jennifer Finney Boylan, The XY Games, The New York Times, 8/03/08)

The feminist debate between gender essentialists and anti-essentialists is a deep and enduring one that ranges over broad topics in metaphysics and epistemology, including realism vs. nominalism, nature vs. nurture, individualistic vs. relational conceptions of the self, and individualistic conceptions of the knowing self (and of knowledge) vs. historical and social conceptions of the knowing self (and of knowledge). It seems to me, however, that it is often unclear what notion of essentialism undergirds these debates. One purpose of this chapter is to sketch out a taxonomy of essentialisms in order to clarify what might be at stake in the debate between gender essentialists and anti-essentialists. My second purpose here is to outline a concept of essentialism that I think both survives the standard feminist criticisms of gender essentialism and has potential value for feminist theory. The concept I have in mind (which I call uniessentialism) has its roots in Aristotle’s metaphysics, but it is fully compatible with a historical and social understanding of gendered individuals.

Uniessentialism is a theory about the unity of individuals, and it holds that individuals are unified and exist as individuals (as opposed to being a heap of parts) by virtue of their essences. For example, a house exists as an individual (as opposed to a jumble of house parts) because its parts are organized in a way that realizes the functional essence of a house. The very same house parts stacked at Lowe’s lack the uniessence of a house; they are, collectively, a heap and not an individual. Organisms are individuals because their parts realize a functional essence that unifies them into an individual over and above the parts. Analogously, we can think of an individual’s gender as providing a normative principle that unifies all that individual’s social roles at a time or over time. A social role is itself a set of norms that attach to a social position; for example, an individual who is a mother (social position) ought to care for her children (norm or social role). Unlike the case of the artifact or the biological organism, in the case of social individuals (us) what is organized by gender is our practical agency and the norms that govern it. In The Metaphysics of Gender I argue that our gender provides a principle of normative unity for our lives as social individuals, and our gender is, therefore, uniessential to us. Here I am primarily concerned to distinguish uniessentialism from other concepts of essentialism, and to show that it is not vulnerable to standard feminist arguments against gender essentialism.

The idea that gender is uniessential to social individuals is useful for feminism for several reasons. First, and foremost, it articulates the central role that gender plays in our social lives, day by day. So, even though it is true that gender norms vary historically and culturally, it is also true (both historically and cross-culturally) that an individual’s gender is, at minimum, a central organizing feature of his or her practical agency. Gender uniessentialism expresses the centrality of our gender in our daily lives and social agency without positing an unchanging, ahistorical, universal essence of womanhood (and manliness) hovering over our heads and tying our hands. In order to begin to make a case for this idea, however, it is necessary to differentiate uniessentialism about gender from other theories of gender essentialism. That is my project here.

I begin by distinguishing between kind and individual essentialism. Essentialism about a kind holds that there is a property or properties definitive of membership in that kind. Essentialism about an individual holds that there is a property or properties that make that individual the individual it is. Here I focus on individual essentialism applied to gender. A further distinction is required, however, to sort out different versions of individual essentialism, namely, to distinguish Aristotle’s unification essentialism from Kripke’s identity essentialism.

Following my preliminary taxonomy of essentialisms, I focus on uniessentialism. I explain how and why I use uniessentialism to express gender essentialism. I then revisit identity essentialism, and consider the way some philosophers use it to discuss gender (and race) essentialism. The purpose of this section is to clarify the differences between uniessentialism and identity essentialism in relation to the topic of gender essentialism.

Finally, it is useful to round out my taxonomy of essentialisms by considering Locke’s distinction between nominal and real essences. Feminist debate concerning essentialism frequently turns on disagreement between gender realists and gender nominalists, and the concepts framing this debate originate with Locke. Some feminists have argued for adopting a theory of nominal essences about gender (Fuss 5; de Lauretis 3). Others are gender realists (Haslanger; Zack, “Inclusive”; Alcoff). As it turns out, however, the realism/nominalism debate among feminists is tangential to my focus here as it concerns the basis for membership in gender kinds.

**A Brief Taxonomy of Essentialisms**

Traditionally the notion of essence has had two different applications. First, we can think about essences in relation to kinds, and we can ask whether or not a collection of individuals constitutes a kind that is defined by a common and unique property (or properties). An essence in this sense is a property that determines kind membership.  In addition, some theories add the requirement that essential properties have causal or explanatory power.  Kinds defined by properties that meet the second requirement are sometimes called “natural kinds” because standard examples of natural kinds include biological species and material substances like water.  For convenience, let us call essentialism about kinds and the criteria for kind membership, kind essentialism.

Many feminists deny that women (and men) are kinds whose members share a defining property, and they reject gender essentialism understood as a claim about kind membership.  In other words, they reject gender realism. Since women (and men) form social kinds or groups, not natural kinds, their membership cannot be defined by a shared property. This argument assumes that only membership in natural kinds (like biological species) could be defined by a common property because only natural kinds are stable and homogenous. In contrast, the features that characterize women (and men) vary over time and across different cultures and, as a result, there are no features that are common to all women (or to all men). Finally, as Elizabeth Spelman argues in Inessential Woman, there is also variation within a single culture due to the intersection of gender with other social identities, like race or class. So, even within one culture, there is no possibility of a shared feature or features common to all women or to all men that could determine kind membership. Those who would advocate gender essentialism (understood as kind essentialism) mistake what is social and variable for what is natural and fixed. I call this the core argument against gender essentialism (“Anti-Essentialism” 324). Further, given the variability of women, kind essentialism will necessarily marginalize and exclude some women by defining kind membership using properties that they do not have. I call this the exclusion argument against gender essentialism (“Anti-Essentialism” 327). I return to these criticisms below, after introducing a second notion of essence.

A second notion of essence is that of a property or characteristic that makes an individual the individual that it is. An essence in this sense is a special kind of property of an individual; the property is necessary, or it tells us what the individual is fundamentally.6 Let us call this type of essentialism, individual essentialism. The question of what makes an individual the individual it is can be understood in at least two ways, and the two interpretations yield slightly different theories of individual essentialism.

The first way, which yields a view I call unification essentialism (or uniessentialism), originates with Aristotle. For Aristotle the question “what is it?” asked of an individual substance expands into a question about the unity and organization of material parts into a new individual. He asks: Why do these materials constitute a house? And the answer is that they realize the functional property that defines being a house, which is to shelter humans and animals. Being a shelter for humans and animals is what makes these materials a house rather than a heap of stuff or a sum of parts. The house’s functional property explains why a new, unified individual exists at all.

The second interpretation, which yields a view I call identity essentialism, is associated with Kripke. For Kripke the question—What makes an individual be the individual it is?—concerns the identity of the individual. What makes this lectern the very individual it is (as opposed to some other lectern)? One answer is that it must be made from the very materials from which it, in fact, originated. If it had originated from a different piece of wood, then it would not be this very lectern. Its origins are a necessary property of the lectern (“Identity”). Notice that its material origins are not an essential property of the house on the Aristotelian (or unification) understanding of essential property. Hence there is reason to think that these are two different theories of individual essentialism in the sense that they respond to different questions about individuals. Aristotle explains why a new individual exists at all over and above the sum of its material constituents or parts. In contrast, Kripke begins with an existing individual and asks about which of that individual’s properties are necessary to be that very individual.7

Let me now return to the core argument and the exclusion argument against gender essentialism. My response to them here will be brief8: Neither the core argument nor the exclusion argument establish their conclusions. Let’s begin with the core argument. The fact that an individual, institution or kind has a social origin or social definition does not in and of itself rule out essentialism about that individual, institution or kind. Think of Aristotle’s house or Kripke’s lectern: the fact that they are artifacts does not rule out ipso facto that they might have essential properties. The core argument does not—in itself—establish anti-essentialism about gender.

The exclusion argument targets kind essentialism about gender because it holds that the properties proposed to define membership in gender kinds necessarily exclude some women and some men. My response is twofold. First, individual and kind essentialism are, in principle, independent of one another, and so the conclusion of the exclusion argument, even if true, does not apply to individual essentialism, which is my focus. Second, the exclusion argument needs to be supplemented by some other theoretical notion, like that of intersectionality, in order to tell against kind essentialism about gender. Without a theory that shows exclusion to be the inevitable result of attempts to define membership in gender kinds, the exclusion argument works in a cautionary fashion to warn against hasty generalization or over-generalization. If that is right, then the exclusion argument—by itself—does not establish anti-essentialism (or anti-realism) about gender kinds.9

As Natalie Stoljar points out, individual and kind essentialism are often not clearly distinguished by feminists who argue against gender essentialism (261). And, as we have just seen, most feminist criticisms of gender essentialism are directed against kind essentialism (or gender realism). My interest in individual essentialism has several sources. First, because individual gender essentialism is relatively unexplored territory, it is still possible to say something interesting and useful about it. But another, more significant, reason for my focus is that individual essentialism seems to express the centrality of gender in our lived experiences. Kind essentialism expresses the powerful political idea that I share something in common with all other women, and provides a basis for political solidarity. But individual essentialism expresses the equally compelling idea that my gender is constitutive of my being the social individual that I am. In my experience most women and most men think it is simply obvious that their gender is inextricably interwoven in their social existences and identities. This intuition deserves exploration by feminists even though it is not clear what it means or perhaps because it is not clear what it means. Finally, it is individual essentialism, rather than kind essentialism, that intersects with questions of agency, and the issue of agency is central to feminist theory.

I use an Aristotelian model to express uniessentialism; the essence is the cause of being of the individual (“Substance”). More precisely, its essence causes these materials or parts to constitute a new individual substance rather than a mere pile of stuff or collection of parts. The numerous social positions that we occupy are systematically unified by our gender; hence, our gender is uniessential to us as social beings. The unity of social agents is not a relationship among material parts; it is a relationship of normative unity among our various social position occupancies. There is much more to say about the concept of normative unity, and I discuss it in some detail in The Metaphysics of Gender. Here, I limit my focus to describing my model for uniessentialism and explaining how it applies to gender.

I think that individual and kind essentialism are conceptually independent of one another. On many accounts of “Aristotelian essentialism”, however, the species form (e.g., for humans the property of rationality) is both common to all members of the species and essential to the existence of each individual (Spelman; Stoljar, “Essence”; Alcoff). This is not my interpretation of Aristotle’s theory of form and essence, but it is a common and traditional understanding of his view. So, in at least one important example, the two essentialisms are intertwined. If kind and individual essentialism were always related in this way, then there would only be one view to discuss in which the essence is both a universal species form and the cause of being of individuals. But if, as I argue below, individual essentialism and kind essentialism are conceptually independent of one another, and respond to different philosophical issues, then I will not need to defend kind essentialism about gender in order to make my case for individual essentialism. 

Individual essentialism, as I have just explained, comes in at least two varieties. Unification essentialism asks why a new, unified individual exists over and above a sum of parts or materials. Identity essentialism asks about which properties an individual must have in order to be that very individual, the same individual. Kind essentialism, in contrast, is a view about what property or properties an individual must have in order to be a member of a given kind. What is the relationship between individual and kind essentialism? I will argue that the two essentialisms are—in principle—independent of one another. They are independent of one another because they address distinct philosophical questions. This is true of both varieties of individual essentialism. Let us focus first on the difference between unification essentialism and kind essentialism.

To see that unification and kind essentialism are—in principle—conceptually independent of one another let us consider the example of a biological organism. We can ask two very different questions about it. First, what makes the organism an individual? An organism, like an animal or a cell, is a composite of many individual parts, and yet it is also an individual itself, not just a collection or sum of individuals. What is it that orders or organizes the individual parts so that they compose a unified individual? It seems that an adequate answer to this question must be a relational property that orders all of the individual parts into a functional unity, and that functional unity is an individual organism. The relational property is the uniessence of the organism; it is by virtue of realizing a particular function that the parts of an organism are unified into an individual. Its function is uniessential to the organism.

A different question is whether or not animals (i.e., individual organisms) should be grouped into species understood as natural kinds and, if they should, what the basis is for these groupings. This is to raise the issue of kind essentialism with respect to animals. But the question of kind essentialism assumes that individual animals (i.e., organisms) exist, and therefore it is raising a different question from the one addressed by unification essentialism. Maybe animals should be grouped into natural kinds? But maybe they should be understood to form populations rather than natural kinds? Maybe species are individuals and their members (i.e., organisms) are parts of the individual? Questions like these are conceptually independent of the question of why an organism is an individual. 

I have used the example of biological organisms to illustrate the different questions raised by unification and kind essentialism and to show that they are conceptually independent of one another—at least in principle. We can draw a parallel distinction with regard to gender essentialism. The property or properties (if there are any) that are shared by all men or by all women and form the basis of gender kinds need not be uniessential to individual men or individual women. For example, it could be the case that the basis for grouping women as a class or kind is that they are recognized to have a certain reproductive function, and yet it not be the case that any individual woman is a unified individual because of her gender. Aristotle differentiated between men and women (the male and the female) because of their different reproductive functions, but he did not think that either men or women were individuals because of their reproductive functions. Rather, he thought that both men and women were constituted as individuals by virtue of the presence of human soul (conceived of functionally) in their bodies. The human soul (conceived of functionally) is uniessential to both individual men and individual women; but men (as a kind) are defined in terms of the male reproductive function, and women (as a kind) are defined in terms of the female reproductive function. Because unification and kind essentialism address different questions it is possible to develop an argument for unification gender essentialism that does not include an argument for kind gender essentialism. 

**Uniessentialism and Gender**

I am interested in the question of whether our gender (being a man, being a woman) is essential to us as social individuals.  In order to explore this issue I use an Aristotelian model to express gender essentialism. For Aristotle the essence is the cause of being of the individual whose essence it is. Both artifacts and biological organisms have material parts that are organized into an individual that is not identical to the sum of its material parts. In both cases we can ask why the material parts constitute a new individual rather than a heap or a collection of parts. Hence, both artifacts and biological organisms have essences in that they both have a principle that explains their existence as individuals. Artifacts and biological individuals are also similar because the principle that explains their existence as individuals is a functional essence. A functional essence is an essential property that explains what the individual is for, what its purpose is and that organizes the parts towards that end. Of course, the origin of the purpose differs in the case of artifacts and natural beings. For artifacts the purpose has an external origin in the intentions and purposes of human beings, whereas the purposes of biological individuals are intrinsic to the organism.

It is important to be clear that the question of why a sum of parts makes up a new individual is not a causal question. To use Aristotle’s idiolect, it is important to distinguish between the cause of being (ontological question) and the cause of becoming (causal question). One could ask, for example, about how a house is constructed out of building materials where that would be a question about the process of pouring concrete, building a frame, etc. This is a causal question where the answer specifies the causal factors that produce an individual artifact (or an individual organism). The ontological question is not about the process of generation; rather it focuses upon the existence of an individual, which is not simply the sum of its parts. What explains the existence of an individual? What accounts for the fact that it is an individual?

Here is the Aristotelian model exemplified by an artifact, a house. A sum of material parts that realizes the functional property or properties of a house is a house, and its house functional property is essential to the house. The functional properties of a house unify the building materials (or parts) into a new individual, a house. It is because these bricks and boards (or these windows and doors) realize the function of providing shelter to humans and animals that an individual house exists. If the very same parts were scattered across a junkyard (or neatly arranged at Lowe’s), then they would not realize the house function (providing shelter, etc.) and a house would not exist. Its house functional properties are uniessential to the individual house. The essence explains why a collection of parts are unified into a new individual.

Uniessentialism is not kind essentialism. The two theories address different questions or problems, and the issues or problems are, in principle, independent of one another. Uniessentialism explains why an individual exists rather than a heap. For instance, the house functional properties explain why certain materials are an individual house rather than a mere jumble (or some other artifact). Absent the house functional properties, we would not have an individual; we would have a collection of building materials. In parallel fashion we can ask about why an individual organism exists, e.g., a human being, rather than a collection of body parts (heart, lung, brain). The question of whether, and on what basis, artifacts like houses and natural beings, like organisms, are kinds is—in principle—a conceptually independent question. It may turn out, for example, that biological species are not natural kinds, and that kind essentialism does not hold of biological species, but that finding is—in principle—conceptually independent of the truth of uniessentialism applied to organisms. 

Uniessentialism is also not identity essentialism. Although the functional essence of the house explains why an individual exists (over and above its parts), it does not thereby secure its particular identity. As far as its function goes, it is just like the house next door. In contrast, identity essentialism asks what makes this individual the very individual it is. In order to be this very individual, a house must be made from the materials actually used to construct it. A human being must originate from the very sperm and egg from which she actually did originate; a lectern must be made from the very wood from which it was, in fact, made. Identity essentialism is also—in principle—independent from kind essentialism because it need not broach the question of artifactual or biological kinds in its investigation of individual identity.

Notice that the uniessential properties of the house are functional properties that are realized in and by its material parts. Functional properties are relational rather than intrinsic properties. A window serves its function in relation to the house as a whole and its other components. Also, the functional properties of artifacts are always enmeshed in a broad social context of use. A house has the function of providing shelter, true, but that function is embedded in various social practices (e.g., architecture), social structures (e.g., patriarchal households) and other conditions. And finally, functional properties have a normative dimension because the function specifies what that object ought to do, and not simply what it does. A house with a leaky roof is a house, even if it is nonfunctional in relation to its essential task of providing shelter. Because functional properties are normative, it is possible for an individual to have a function that it cannot or does not perform. A house that was flooded by Hurricane Katrina is a house even though it does not (and perhaps cannot) perform its function.

Turning to the application of Aristotle’s model to gender: A social individual (or agent) occupies many social positions simultaneously (and many more diachronically), but its gender unifies the sum of social position occupancies into a new social individual. Its gender (being a man, being a woman) is uniessential to the social individual. It is worthwhile pausing here to provide a preliminary clarification of two important features of my application of unification essentialism to gender: (1) the claim that gender is essential to social individuals and (2) the unifying role of gender.

My application of the Aristotelian model to gender uses the notion of a social individual, and it is reasonable to wonder exactly what a social individual is. In The Metaphysics of Gender I distinguish social individuals from both human organisms and persons. Persons are the individuals who are the loci of rights and responsibilities, who have autonomy, the first person perspective or whatever other feature defines ethical subjects (Baker, “Bodies”; Friedman). By human organisms I mean individuals who are members of the human species, who realize the human genotype or satisfy whatever other criteria are proposed to define membership in the human species. Not every member of the human species is a person (e.g., a baby), and, conversely, there could be persons who are not members of the human species (Baker, “Persons”). Social individuals are those individuals who occupy social positions— indeed, multiple social positions—both synchronically and diachronically. Social individuals differ from human organisms because their actions are bound by social normativity, which is different from biological normativity in two respects. First, social norms are not species-based: they are flexible and variable and differ from culture to culture. Second, the normativity of social normativity requires the recognition by others that an individual is obligated to obey or fulfill the norm. Social individuals differ from persons in that they are necessarily embodied and necessarily exist in a web of social relations.

Let us now consider the second point in need of clarification. In the case of an artifact, the functional essence unifies the material parts into an individual. It is because the building materials are unified and organized so as to realize the property of being a shelter for humans that an individual house exists. But what does the gender functional essence unify in order to constitute a social individual? And what notion of unity is relevant? At any given moment, a social individual occupies multiple roles—professor, parent, etc.—and the question is what unites those social position occupancies so that a social individual exists? How are they unified and organized? A bundle of social position occupancies is not an individual, just as a heap of house parts is not an individual house. Just as the function of providing shelter unifies that heap of boards, nails, etc. into a house, gender is a pervasive and fundamental social position that unifies and determines all our other social positions both synchronically and diachronically. It unifies them not physically, but by providing a principle of normative unity. It is as a woman that I am a parent or a professor (or whatever the full range of my social roles might be at the moment or over time). Of course, there is much more to be said about normative unity and whether there is a single principle of normative unity or many principles, and I discuss these issues in The Metaphysics of Gender.

In this essay, however, I am simply interested in describing unification essentialism applied to gender and distinguishing it from other ways of expressing gender essentialism. I will not give any reason or argument to believe that gender essentialism is true or even plausible. Rather, my goal is to introduce the Aristotelian model as a way of thinking about—or expressing—the unifying role that gender plays in our social lives. In order to continue with the description of unification essentialism and its application to gender, it is useful to contrast it with identity essentialism, and to consider the application of identity essentialism to gender and to race.

**Identity Essentialism and Gender**

Identity essentialism is intimately connected with modality; an individual’s essential properties are its necessary properties. Moreover, Kripke’s views on individual essences are articulated within the semantic framework of a theory of reference for proper names. According to Kripke, proper names do not have meanings or senses, but rather refer directly to individuals. (Both the details of this theory, and its application to kind terms (tiger) and substance terms (water) are beyond the scope of this discussion.) Kripke frames the question of the essences of individuals as follows:

Here is a lectern. A question which has often been raised in philosophy is:What are its essential properties? What properties, aside from trivial ones like self-identity, are such that this object has to have them if it exists at all, are such that if an object did not have it, it would not be this object? (86)

In this text Kripke raises the question of the essential features of individuals, what I call individual essentialism.  It is important to see that Kripke is not asking us to imagine what changes an artifact like the lectern could undergo and still persist. Rather than thinking temporally about change, we are to think modally, about possibility and necessity. The properties an object must have if it exists at all are the properties that if the object did not have them, it would not be that very object. Kripke classifies the necessary properties of individuals into three sorts: properties of origin (a material object must come from the very hunk of matter it did come from), sortal properties (being a lectern is a necessary property of a lectern), and properties of substance (a material object must be made from the kind of matter it is in fact made from). In another text, Kripke discusses the example of the Queen of England, saying that the necessary property of origin is the very sperm and egg from which, in fact, the Queen originated (Kripke). In biological individuals, the necessity of origins is identified with the original genetic materials, the sperm and egg.

As we have just seen, unification essentialism is not formulated using modal notions (possibility, necessity).  Further, unlike Kripke’s theory, it does not depend upon any particular semantics for those notions or for names and natural kind terms. Unification essentialism is not constructed out of the same theoretical ingredients as Kripke’s theory (Witt, “Substance”; Charles). The basic difference, however, concerns what issue the theories address. Unification essentialism asks why a hunk of matter or an assemblage of material parts constitutes an individual. Why does an individual exist at all, over and above a collection of parts? In contrast, Kripke asks of an individual which of its properties it must have in order to be that very individual. What properties must an individual have to be this very individual, the same individual? Although both questions are about individuals and not kinds, they are not the very same questions. For convenience I refer to Kripke’s essentialism as identity essentialism because it uses our intuitions concerning the identity of individuals to determine what their essential properties are.

Some philosophers use Kripke’s identity essentialism to explore essentialism about race or gender (Appiah; Stoljar, 286; Zack, “Race”). Appiah, for example, explicitly couches his reflections on race, sex and gender in relation to Kripke’s theory. Appiah begins by distinguishing between questions of metaphysical or biological identity and questions of ethical identity. Our metaphysical or biological identity is what Kripke was talking about in holding that human beings necessarily come from the very same sperm and egg we actually came from (the necessity of origin applied to biological beings). In this metaphysical/biological context, if I originated from genetic material with XX chromosomes, then, given the necessity of origin, I would not be me unless I was genetically female.  We can contrast the biological determinations of female and male with the social roles of being a woman or being a man. It is possible for a biological female to live as a man or a biological male to live as a woman. In relation to this distinction, Appiah introduces the notion of the ethical self. “As many think of them sex—female and male, the biological statuses—and gender—masculine and feminine, the social roles—provide the sharpest model for a distinction between the metaphysical notion of identity that goes with Kripkean theorizing and the notion of identity—the ethical notion—that I am seeking to explore” (77). The ethical self is an individual with projects and a self-conception. In the ethical context, when we ask the question “But would it still be me?”, the answer reflects our self-conception as social agents rather than an external metaphysical/scientific truth like the necessity of origin or the biological determination of sex. Appiah thinks that a change in his gender would usher into existence a new ethical self, whereas a change in his race would not.

I have described Appiah’s views in some detail, not so much to take issue with them, but rather to explain that I do not develop individual essentialism about gender along the lines that he pursues. As Appiah sees it, the question of gender essentialism is a question about an individual’s ethical or pragmatic self-conception. My approach differs from Appiah’s because I do not think that the question of gender essentialism is fundamentally a question about an individual’s self-conception. Rather, I believe that our self-conceptions are formed in relation to the social positions that we occupy, and my focus is on the way that our social position occupancies are unified and organized. There is an important, ontological question about the unity of the social individual that is prior to, and independent of, how we understand ourselves. Uniessentialism is a theory that explains how a collection of parts is unified so that a new individual exists, but Appiah’s identity approach takes the individual (whether the metaphysical/biological human organism or the ethical self) as a given, and then asks about what conditions must be met to be that very individual.

Finally, let us finish this taxonomy of essentialisms by considering nominal essences. Some feminists argue that Locke’s theory of nominal essences provides an account of the meaning of gender terms that is preferable to the Aristotelian approach.  For that reason Locke is an important figure in the feminist debates over gender essentialism, and I end my taxonomy of essentialisms with a consideration of his theory in relation to the distinction between individual and kind essentialism.

It was the only gas station open so it was pretty busy and there were two groups of guys-one was just two guys around 25-29 and the other was four guys and one girl who were all probably 20-24.

One guy from the group of two turned around while we were waiting in line and said very loudly ""holy shit is that a hickey? that things huge!!"" and his friend was like ""tell him to slow down next time"" and the the guy working at the register was said ""yeah she's probably pregnant now"" they all continued to laugh and talk about it while I stood there and ignored them obviously very uncomfortable. Everyone was staring at me as the three of them talked about it. I considered leaving without my stuff because the checkout guy was even joining in but i paid and left. Everybody just stood there and nobody said anything as the three of them made fun of me for the about five minutes I was in line.

""Seven current and former University of Rochester professors submitted a [111-page complaint](https://www.scribd.com/document/358502273/University-of-Rochester-Eeoc) detailing nearly a decade of serial sexual harassment and bullying on the part of Professor Florian Jaeger, and the retaliation they faced after reporting him. 

The document is long and full of awful behavior. The University promoted Jaeger to full professor WHILE HE WAS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. Here is a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/OutsideOfDog/status/906563977282383873) pointing out some of the highlights (lowlights?). There was also [a Mother Jones piece about the scandal](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/09/she-was-a-rising-star-at-a-major-university-then-a-lecherous-professor-made-her-life-hell/), but it doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of how everything has been mishandled.

University of Rochester president issued [a response likening the complaint to the discredited Rolling Stone UVa piece](http://www.rochester.edu/president/memos/2017/eeoc-filing.html), so basically accusing the complainants of lying. Even though the complainants filed publicly and include detailed references to witness testimony from nearly a dozen victims. And even though the university's own investigation found that Jaeger had sexual relations with current and prospective graduate students that he had power over.

I hope this story gets much more widespread attention. It's a case of an institution choosing to believe the word of one powerful man over the complaints of many less powerful women. 


Edit: Glad to see that this got so many views and so much support! As noted in some of the comments, there's a [change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/university-of-rochester-remove-florian-jaeger-and-reevaluate-sexual-harrassment-policy) if you like signing things. The University of Rochester's president Joel Seligman can be reached at seligman@rochester.edu and (585)275-8356.

I also want to point out that a big focus in the complaint is that the University did conduct an investigation, but it was too cursory and seemed more concerned about protecting the University than its students. Thus President Seligman's protests that ""we went through the process"" ignores the complaints that the process is inadequate.

As an example, a student who worked in Jaeger's lab as an undergraduate entered into a sexual relationship with him shortly after she graduated, but while she was still employed by the department and relying on him for letters of recommendation for grad school applications. The University declined to interview her because the relationship happened after she graduated, so it was technically okay - never mind that he wielded great power over her career or could have been grooming her while she worked in his lab as an undergraduate.""",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,7 University of Rochester profs submit 111-page complaint detailing serial sexual harassment and retaliation for whistleblowing; university president responds by calling them liars,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/6zljjw/7_university_of_rochester_profs_submit_111page/

[About the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Feminist)

Bad Feminist: Essays is a 2014 collection of essays by cultural critic, novelist and professor Roxane Gay. Bad Feminist explores being a feminist while loving things that could seem at odds with feminist ideology. Gay's essays engage pop culture and her personal experiences, covering topics as diverse as the Sweet Valley High series, Django Unchained, and Gay's own upbringing as a Haitian-American.

The essays in Bad Feminist address a wide variety of topics, both cultural and personal. The collection of essays is broken into five sections: Me; Gender &amp; Sexuality; Race &amp; Entertainment; Politics, Gender &amp; Race; and Back to Me. In a 2014 interview with Time, Gay explained her role as a feminist and how it has influenced her writing: ""In each of these essays, I’m very much trying to show how feminism influences my life for better or worse. It just shows what it’s like to move through the world as a woman. It’s not even about feminism per se, it’s about humanity and empathy.""

The shitty side: Drag is basically a charicature of female stereotypes. We use all the worst, most offensive words about women constantly, pretend to be, basically, trashy, slutty etc. It feels on some level to be equivalent to blackface.

The good side: Fuuuuck gender. If people are going to tell me that I have to be masculine, then fuck that, I'm going full circle and going to doll my face up with a ton of makeup, put on a dress, and tell people to get fucked if they don't like it. I want to hangout and talk trash with (male and female) friends at a club where no one gives a shit that I'm wearing 6 inch heels.

The donor completely dismissed me and told me to ask my two male colleagues (one of whom hasn't even worked at our office in 2 years) instead of my female colleague who this donor knew was in charge of the event.

Another donor, who might donate the largest amount of money to us, calls married female coworker ""babe"" and says a bunch of other things that I find really insulting. Luckily, I haven't had to interact much with that donor yet.

A little 6 year old girl had her hair dyed with her mom's permission and faced backlash online.

http://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1128493/mom-gives-kid-unicorn-hair

Girls are getting mass 'dress coded' for wearing things even two decades ago wouldn't even turn a head.

http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/news/a44267/mom-principal-daughter-shopping-dress-code/

There is a little girl and her family who run a channel on Youtube and they are being harassed and bullied and some are trying to shut down their channel.  Why?  Because she is a little girl.  The video titled ""Bad Baby steals car"" has over 1k dislikes to 5k likes.  I've seen them have to deal with trolls.  This little girl can't just enjoy her life.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0UghWZSs22VMCFeuesQ5Vw

There is a war on little girls and girls under the guise of ""protecting"" them.  They receive harassment on instagram and many other online communities just for existing.  I talked to a mom who's little girl got her video banned because she was simply stretching and doing gymnastics in a leotard.

Shane TV as well as many other channels have lead 'Crusades' against little girl's channels.  I suspect many of the perverted comments are really just alt-right trolls.  Then you have the comments calling the little girls 'whores' 'sluts' or that 'they know what they are doing'.  They argue that they cannot consent to such activities but then directly insult their characters.

As Feminists I have to ask you why can't a little girl post videos to youtube without her videos being sexualized by alt-right crusaders?  Dancing and gymnastics are being demonized and videos are getting taken down.  The alt-right crusaders claim that its because of the comments but why should the girls be punished because of the comments?  A young girl cannot live her life because some boy or man might comment about it?  That is bullshit!

Transgendered children are being harassed and bullied for their choices.  It is constant.  You can see videos posted all over the net.

Queer Kid's stuff is often a target of the alt-right as well.

Kristina Pimenova and her family have been threatened for years because her mother allows her to model.  People threaten her way of life on a daily basis.  Now there is a push to classify many non-nude images of little girls as CHILD PORNOGRAPHY!!!  If they accomplish this well young girls wont be able to do anything they want.  They wont even be able to play sports and have it photographed least it be considered CP.

Point is everything a little girl might do is demonized.  As someone who truly loves little girls I want to free them from this injustice.

Obv anyone white and even remotely aware of the world isn't going to use the n word. most don't even say it even when talking ""about"" it iyswim. Like me here typing ""n word"", such is the power surrounding this word.

But singing it? In the context of a song released to the public by a black artist? Is that an issue?

Personally it's something I do when singing along in the car, I would feel uncomfortable singing it in front of a black person though....I can't pinpoint why that is because I don't think any of the black people I know would care, but they might I guess...it;s just ingrained in me that you don't say it, singing being the only exception or perhaps when quoting lines from movies.

I have already read a few ""typical"" or shall I say, popular books on feminism and gender. Such as, Laura Bates Girl Up and Everyday Sexism, Delusions of Gender by Cordelia Fine, Feminine Mystique, The Beauty Within, as well as, and the popular female comedians books, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Amy Schumer, Caitlan Moran, Lena Durham, etc.

However I love to read/listen, and I can't seem to find many other female empowering books or podcasts. Even when I search for these things on youtube or such there's endless trolls on feminism (snore). I just wanted to expand my horizons a bit more, and also make it a little less White Popular readings! As i'm sure there's plenty I just can't find them/would love some recommedations.

Please do not leave any recommendations either on sort of ""basic"" Feminism explorations, as even though I know quite a lot already from other resources, I still like to read something from a powerful woman -- amirite?

Anything from historical to just celebrating a great powerful piece of literature would be really great please :)",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,Feminism Podcasts/Books/Anything Highly Recommended,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/71rgha/feminism_podcastsbooksanything_highly_recommended/

I have a genuine question that I can't seem to figure out on my own.  I don't know if this is an instinctual thing or a learned response, but for some reason every time gay men make references to their non-existent vaginas in any form (it's usually in a cheap, sarcastic and vulgar way) it really offends me.  I'm honestly trying to figure out why.  I have no problem with gay people, I have gay family members who I love and am loosely bi-sexual myself.  None of this is an issue to me.  It's just when gay men make these sorts of comments.  It feels like they're insulting women's bodies somehow.

Can someone help me understand this so I can figure out a way to cope with it, or if it really is offensive and I have a right to be upset?",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,Why does it anger me when gay men talk like they have female anatomy?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/731cdp/why_does_it_anger_me_when_gay_men_talk_like_they/

He then started talking about how its not fair Puerto Ricans and Latinos can receive affirmative action over someone who has been an American citizen like him (I guess affirmative action means that they get prioritized hiring?)

It was so frustrating. Like I know he's wrong and his sentiments are bigoted, but I didn't have the facts to back up my side.

Yet when I bring up that that's precisely the feminist idea and that if they believe that, then they are a feminist, a lot of the time they seem to get offended. They then start with various accusations and excuses as to why feminism is bad and feminists are evil. Here is a conversation I've just had here on reddit:

-person: I disagree with the feminist movement in almost every way. I see my self more as an egalitarian than a feminist

-me: Then you don't understand what feminism is. It's the belief that women and men should have equal rights and opportunities. If you're for equality between sexes you're a feminist.

-person: They might believe that but it's not what they're trying to get. They don't advocate equality at all, just look at how they talk about rape for instance, they NEVER take into account male victims of rape. The majority of the movement advocates that females are the only victims
I advocate real equality be it race or sex/gender. I take offense to being labelled as a feminist for having that belief

Why is it that they seem to want to hate feminism with such a *passion*? It feels to me like those particular individuals can't accept a movement that isn't all about them. That as soon as their gender isn't the center of attention they can't cope. 

If you really are for equality as you say you are, why can't you accept feminsim? After all, that's its purpose. I'm sure many people have had experiences with this, do you have any theories on why this happens? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

We’re creating r/feminisme, a subreddit for french speakers to discuss women’s issues and feminism. (It is actually more of a re-launch since the sub was created five years ago and laid dormant all that time).

We are hoping to find French speakers here who might be interested in subscribing/participating to the sub. Right now the sub is more focused on France, but we would be very interested in learning from French speakers around the world. 

The subreddit is here : https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminisme/  (as you can see we only just started posting again).

And the rules are here : https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminisme/wiki/regles

Best of luck to everyone and thanks for reading !

""Everywhere I go I proudly tell folks who want to know who I am and what I do that I am a writer, a feminist theorist, a cultural critic. I tell them I write about movies and popular culture, analyzing the message in the medium. Most people find this exciting and want to know more. everyone goes to movies, watches television, glances through magazines, and everyone has thoughts about the messages they receive, about the images they look at. It is easy for the diverse public I encounter to understand what I do as a cultural critic, to understand my passion for writing (lots of want to write, and do). But feminist theory - that’s the place where the questions stop. Instead I tend to hear all about the evil of feminism and the bad feminists: how “they” hate men; how “they” want to go against nature and god; how “they” are all lesbians; how “they” are taking all the jobs and making the world hard for white men, who do not stand a chance.

When I ask these same folks about the feminist books or magazines they read, when I ask them about the feminist talks they have heard, about the feminist activists they know, they respond by letting me know that everything they know about feminism has come into their lives third-hand, that they really have not come close enough to feminist movement to know what really happens, what it’s really about. Mostly they think feminism is a bunch of angry women who want to be like men. They do not even think about feminism as being about rights - about women gaining equal rights. When I talk about the feminism I know - up close and personal - they willingly listen, although when our conversations end, they are quick to tell me I am different, not like the “real” feminists who hate men, who are angry. I assure them I am as a real and as radical a feminist as one can be, and if they dare to come closer to feminism they will see it is not how they have imagined it.

Each time I leave one of these encounters, I want to have in my hand a little book so that I can say, read this book, and it will tell you what feminism is, what the movement is about. I want to be holding in my hand a concise, fairly easy to read and understand book; not a long book, not a book thick with hard to understand jargon and academic language, but a straightforward, clear book - easy to read without being simplistic. From the moment feminist thinking, politics, and practice changed my life, I have wanted this book. I have wanted to give it to the folk I love so that they can understand better this cause, this feminist politics I believe in so deeply, that is the foundation of my political life.I have wanted them to have an answer to the question “what is feminism?” that is rooted neither in fear or fantasy. I have wanted them to have this simple definition to read again and again so they know: “Feminism is a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression.” I love this definition, which I first offered more than 10 years ago in my book Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center. I

love it because it so clearly states that the movement is not about being anti-male. It makes it clear that the problem is sexism. And that clarity helps us remember that all of us, female and male, have been socialized from birth on to accept sexist thought and action. As a consequence, females can be just as sexist as men. And while that does not excuse or justify male domination, it does mean that it would be naive and wrong-minded for feminist thinkers to see the movement as simplistically being for women against men. To end patriarchy (another way of naming the institutionalized sexism) we need to be clear that we are all participants in perpetuating sexism until we change our minds and hearts, until we let go of sexist thought and action and replace it with feminist thought and action.

Males as a group have and do benefit the most from patriarchy, from the assumption that they are superior to females and should rule over us. But those benefits have come with a price. In return for all the goodies men receive from patriarchy, they are required to dominate women, to exploit and oppress us, using violence if they must to keep patriarchy intact. Most men find it difficult to be patriarchs. Most men are disturbed by hatred and fear of women, by male violence against women, even the men who perpetuate this violence. But they fear letting go of the benefits. They are not certain what will happen to the world they know most intimately if patriarchy changes. So they find it easier to passively support male domination even when they know in their minds and hearts that it is wrong. Again and again men tell me they have no idea what it is feminists want. I believe them. I believe in their capacity to change and grow. And I believe that if they knew more about feminism they would no longer fear it, for they would find in feminist movement the hope of their own release from the bondage of patriarchy.

It is for these men, young and old, and for all of us, that I have written this short handbook, the book I

have spent more than 20 years longing for. I had to write it because I kept waiting for it to appear, and it did not. And without it there was no way to address the hordes of people in this nation who are daily bombarded with anti-feminist backlash, who are being told to hate and resist a movement that they know very little about. There should be so many little feminist primers, easy to read pamphlets and books, telling us all about feminism, that this book would be just another passionate voice speaking out on behalf of feminist politics. There should be billboards; ads in magazines; ads on buses, subways, trains; television commercials spreading the word, letting the world know more about feminism. We are not there yet. But this is what we must do to share feminism, to let the movement into everyone’s mind and heart. Feminist change has already touched all our lives in a positive way. And yet we lose sight of the positive when all we hear about feminism is negative.

When I began to resist male domination, to rebel against patriarchal thinking (and to oppose the strongest patriarchal voice in my life - my mother’s voice), I was still a teenager, suicidal, depressed, uncertain about how I would find meaning in my life and a place for myself. I needed feminism to give me a foundation of equality and justice to stand on. Mama has come around to feminist thinking. She sees me and all her daughters (we are six) living better lives because of feminist politics. She sees the promise and hope in feminist movement. It is that promise and hope that I want to share with you in this book, with everybody.

Imagine living in a world where there is no domination, where females and males are not alike or even always equal, but where a vision of mutuality is the ethos shaping our interaction. Imagine living in a world where we can all be who we are, a world of peace and possibility. Feminist revolution alone will not create such a world; we need to end racism, class elitism, imperialism. But it will make it possible for us to be fully self-actualized females and males able to create beloved community, to live together, realizing our dreams of freedom and justice, living the truth that we are all “created equal.” Come closer.

I'm open to hearing the thoughts/opinions of other women, whether it's in agreement or otherwise, I like expanding myself &amp; sharing constructive conversations, and most importantly I never intend any offense or disrespect and am happy to be educated ��

Now that's all been said...! 

Feminism for me is equality. That is a basic 'blanket' description of how I view feminism. I believe a woman is equally as important and valued in society and deserves to be treated accordingly. Any career path, life choice or personal decision is hers alone to make and she is entitled to pursue the life she wishes, just as a man is. There is no job, task or activity she cannot do, there is nothing she cannot do. 

I believe women are entitled to their opinions, thoughts and feelings. They are entitled to express them, share them and discuss them. Women are entitled to agree or disagree. Women are entitled to empower themselves and be who they wish, express themselves however they wish. 

It is, in my mind, very clear cut - feminism = equality. I am no better than you, or a man. I am the same &amp; equal. I matter, I am important and I am entitled to be the woman I wish to be without apology. 

That's how I've come to view feminism in my life. It may be a very basic view that doesn't take every aspect into account, which is another reason I felt compelled to post this. Genuinely not looking for validation because this is just one woman &amp; the belief she has manifested over her life, I feel like I'm just looking to share this and open the floor for a conversation &amp; sharing of thoughts ��

Everytime I say men I mean men who obsess over the false accusations thing and use it against feminism. 

I feel this is a relatively new phenomena... not women falsely accusing men of rape but males claiming oppression because of it. I find this to be an incredible non-issue, and an inadvertent attempt to regress the feminist movement. 


The further we go, unapologetically taking away a man's right to violate a woman in any way, shape or form, they seem to be increasingly uncomfortable with it. 


For example, people are falsely accused of murder. We don't take this up with attempted murder victims, or advocate against laws that prevent murder. Every time a woman falsely accuses a man of rape, it becomes a huge deal and is cited as reasons females have privilege over men. One might argue that it is a privilege because men can not exploit the system to ruin a woman's life simply by accusing her of rape, which admittedly, would most likely not be taken as seriously or cause the same backlash. However, this in itself is a symptom of toxic masculinity, advocated by the patriarchy-not feminism. And while this fact may be true, it illustrates a deeper contention these men harbor.


The reason I feel this way is because **I don't feel it is logical or natural to feel the need to obsess over being falsely accused of something, so far as to spend excessive amount of time speaking/arguing etc about it** I believe the only reason this is even a thing is because it is a male vs. female issue. I believe there is something there subconsciously that resents the power women are beginning to demand and the notion that they may have to one day see us as equals. I believe this something irks these men, in a way they can not identify, they know they don't like the idea that rape is now defined in more clear terms, and that bullying a woman sexually is getting a little more difficult to get away with.


 When I say rape I don't mean breaking into a room in the middle of the night with a ski mask with a knife to the throat- These men are clearly against this and see this as abhorrent. I mean rape as in a close friend taking advantage of the fact that a woman is intoxicated and pushing himself on her even though she is clearly resistant. There is no more room for leeway or speculation. If she did not consent, it is rape. I can only imagine how much this shift must have helped women, men will now think twice before pulling something like that. He is no longer safe in the knowledge that she will be slut-shamed, that she will be scared to speak out. I'm not saying these things don't still happen, but I do believe the trend of trivializing rape and magnifying a woman's sexual conquests is starting to shift. We are on the path to leveling it out currently, a woman's sexual freedom is being encouraged, and rape in ways previously perceived as harmless are being called out for they are.   

I just want to ponder on that right there for a moment. **Why is it so ridiculous and oppressive to require a simple acknowledgement of consent before sex?** No one is asking people to sign a contract before having sex, but even if that was required I still don't feel the backlash we are receiving is justified. If it can protect the safety of your fellow humans why is it seen as a huge oppression/inconvenience/atrocity rather than a part of life? No one complains about being ID'd before being served alcohol or entering a nightclub. Yes, it's unfortunate that some people can not drink responsibly at a certain age, and yes it's unfortunate that some people lie about their age and put the business at risk, yes it's slightly inconvenient that you need to carry your ID on you and pull it out and explicitly show the doorman even though you're innocent and are not partaking in either of those two things. But we do it without complaint or thought don't we? We do it out of habit because we understand that there are laws in place for everyone's protection.... we don't go on and on about the absurdity of having to show an ID.


 Why then is it SO ridiculous to confirm consent before sex? I mean, we are all capable of reading the room, if you find yourself in a situation where you are unsure of consent.... then just ask? Obviously, no one is even saying consent should be explicitly asked for each time before sex as a law or anything, nor am I (back to the being able to read the room thing) but just for the sake of argument even if it was, why is that SUCH a travesty if it may protect a good amount of the population? The only reason I bring that up is what is actually required, is even more trivial than signing a contract or being legally required to ask an exact question... just be respectful and sensitive towards your sexual partner. If this is followed, unless the 'victim' is genuinely trying to be malicious there is essentially no risk of being caught in a situation where there is a misunderstanding of rape. 


Now as for the case of the person who does falsely accuse out of nowhere just for the sake of being malicious. I just don't understand why this is a thing in specific which gets attention-especially since it's used to prevent laws that protect true victims in the first place! Basically **your fear of being falsely accused of something which you have an incredibly low chance of being falsely accused in is given more thought and deems to be a cause worth fighting against at the expense of the actual victims of that crime?!** I'm sorry but to me this is just ridiculous. 



If you do your research you will find the number of people that are falsely accused is incredibly low. There will always be people who are able to make false accusations *for any crime*. Making a false accusation of any sort is relatively easy, getting the person *convicted* on the other hand is a lot more difficult, but this holds true with *any* crime. People falsely accuse others of murders but *why do I not know the names of these people doing the accusations?* Why is there no movement against organizations that condemn countries that are committing genocide because it is so easy to accuse a country of committing genocide? Because that is a ridiculous issue to spend time fighting over. **Why is it in the news every time someone's reputation is ruined because they are falsely accused of rape but not in the news every time a someone is murdered because they were accused of committing a petty theft?**


While these are both issues my last thought I will leave you with is the inherent sexism I see in the way we tackle said issues. Never have I seen such an obsession with the idea of being falsely accused of a crime, at expense at the victims of the crime itself. When someone is falsely accused of a different crime such as theft or murder, we do not fixate on his accuser and fixate on how we can make it so that in the future his accuser will have less credibility or have a harder time prosecuting. We do not blame people who advocate against theft or murder or try to hinder their cause. We do not use it against them to make it more difficult to report or prosecute such crimes. We instead worry about why the due process to determine the accused's innocence did not take place. We worry about why the system failed said person, *We don't direct that towards the group of victims most susceptible to the crime in retaliation*. I guess in the end my question then is why is it that rape is seen so differently than every other crime, why is it that it's a feminists job to defend or advocate jobs preventing rape, or to justify false rape accusations?

""**Feminist Politics - Where We Stand**

Simply put, feminism is a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, and oppression. This was a definition of feminism I offered in Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center more than 10 years ago. It was my hope at the time that it would become a common definition everyone would use. I liked this definition because it did not imply that men were the enemy. By naming sexism as the problem it went directly to the heart of the matter. Practically, it is a definition which implies that all sexist thinking and action is the problem, whether those who perpetuate it are female or male, child or adult. It is also broad enough to include an understanding of systemic institutionalized sexism. As a definition it is open-ended. To understand feminism it implies one has to necessarily understand sexism.

As all advocates of feminist politics know, most people do not understand sexism, or if they do, they think it is not a problem. Masses of people think that feminism is always and only about women seeking to be equal to men. And a huge majority of these folks think feminism is anti-male. Their misunderstanding of feminist politics reflects the reality that most folks learn about feminism from patriarchal mass media. The feminism they hear about the most is portrayed by women who are primarily committed to gender equality - equal pay for equal work, and sometimes women and men sharing household chores and parenting. They see that these women are usually white and materially privileged. They know from mass media that women’s liberation focuses on the freedom to have abortions, to be lesbians, to challenge rape and domestic violence.Among these issues, masses of people agree with the idea of gender equity in the workplace - equal pay for equal work.

Since our society continues to be primarily a “Christian” culture, masses of people continue to believe that god has ordained that women be subordinate to men in the domestic household. Even though masses of women have entered the workforce, even though many families are headed by women who are the sole breadwinners, the vision of domestic life which continues to dominate the nation’s imagination is one in which the logic of male domination is intact, whether men are present in the home or not. The wrong minded notion of feminist movement which implied it was anti-male carried with it the wrong-minded assumption that all female space would necessarily be an environment where patriarchy and sexist thinking would be absent. Many women, even those involved in feminist politics, chose to believe this as well.

There was indeed a great deal of anti-male sentiment among early feminist activists who were responding to male domination with anger. It was that anger at injustice that was the impetus for creating a women’s liberation movement. Early on most feminist activists (a majority of whom were white) had their consciousness raised about the nature of male domination when they were working in anti-classist and anti-racist settings with men who were telling the world about the importance of freedom while subordinating the women in their ranks. Whether it was white women working on behalf of socialism, black women working on behalf of civil rights and black liberation, or Native American women working for indigenous rights, it was clear that men wanted to lead, and they wanted women to follow. Participating in these radical freedom struggles awakened the spirit of rebellion and resistance in progressive females and led them towards contemporary women’s liberation.

As contemporary feminism progressed, as women realized that males were not the only group in our society who supported sexist thinking and behavior - that females could be sexist as well - anti-male sentiment no longer shaped the movement’s consciousness. The focus shifted to an all-out effort to create gender justice. But women could not band together to further feminism without confronting our sexist thinking. Sisterhood could not be powerful as long as women were competitively at war with one another. Utopian visions of sisterhood based solely on the awareness of the reality that all women were in some way victimized by male domination were disrupted by discussions of class and race. Discussions of class differences occurred early on in contemporary feminism, preceding discussions of race. Diana Press published revolutionary insights about class divisions between women as early as the mid-‘70s in their collection of essays Class and Feminism. These discussions did not trivialize the feminist insistence that “sisterhood is powerful,” they simply emphasized that we could only become sisters in struggle by confronting the ways women - through sex, class, and race - dominated and exploited other women, and created a political platform that would address these differences.

Even though individual black women were active in contemporary feminist movement from its inception, they were not the individuals who became the “stars” of the movement, who attracted the attention of mass media. Often individual black women active in feminist movement were revolutionary feminists (like many white lesbians). They were already at odds with reformist feminists who resolutely wanted to project a vision of the movement as being solely about women gaining equality with men in the existing system. Even before race became a talked about issue in feminist circles it was clear to black women (and to their revolutionary allies in struggle) that they were never going to have equality within the existing white supremacist capitalist patriarchy.

From its earliest inception feminist movement was polarized. Reformist thinkers chose to emphasize gender equality. Revolutionary thinkers did not want simply to alter the existing system so that women would have more rights. We wanted to transform that system, to bring an end to patriarchy and sexism. Since patriarchal mass media was not interested in the more revolutionary vision, it never received attention in mainstream press. The vision of “women’s liberation” which captured and still holds the public imagination was the one representing women as wanting what men had. And this was the vision that was easier to realize. Changes in our nation’s economy, economic repression, the loss of jobs, etc., made the climate ripe for our nation’s citizens to accept the notion of gender equality in the workforce.

Given the reality of racism, it made sense that white men were more willing to consider women’s rights when the granting of those rights could serve the interests of maintaining white supremacy.

We can never forget that white women began to assert their need for freedom after civil rights, just at the point when racial discrimination was ending and black people, especially black males, might have attained equality in the workforce with white men. Reformist feminist thinking focusing primarily on equality with men in the workforce overshadowed the original radical foundations of contemporary feminism which called for reform as well as overall restructuring of society so that our nation would be fundamentally anti-sexist.

Most women, especially privileged white women, ceased even to consider revolutionary feminist visions, once they began to gain economic power within the existing social structure. Ironically, revolutionary feminist thinking was most accepted and embraced in academic circles. In those circles the production of revolutionary feminist theory progressed, but more often than not that theory was not made available to the public. It became and remains a privileged discourse available to those among us who are highly literate, well-educated, and usually materially privileged. Works like Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center that offer a liberatory vision of feminist transformation never receive mainstream attention. Masses of people have not heard of this book. They have not rejected its message; they do not know what the message is.

While it was in the interest of mainstream white supremacist capitalist patriarchy to suppress visionary feminist thinking which was not anti-male or concerned with getting women the right to be like men, reformist feminists were also eager to silence these forces. Reformist feminism became their route to class mobility. They could break free of male domination in the workforce and be more self-determining in their lifestyles. While sexism did not end, they could maximize their freedom within the existing system. And they could count on there being a lower class of exploited subordinated women to do the dirty work they were refusing to do. By accepting and indeed colluding with the subordination of working-class and poor women, they not only ally themselves with the existing patriarchy and its concomitant sexism, they give themselves the right to lead a double life, one where they are the equals of men in the workforce and at home when they want to be. If they choose lesbianism they have the privilege of being equals with men in the workforce while using class power to create domestic lifestyles where they can choose to have little or no contact with men.

Lifestyle feminism ushered in the notion that there could be as many versions of feminism as there were women. Suddenly the politics was being slowly removed from feminism. And the assumption prevailed that no matter what a woman’s politics, be she conservative or liberal, she too could fit feminism into her existing lifestyle. Obviously this way of thinking has made feminism more acceptable because its underlying assumption is that women can be feminists without fundamentally challenging and changing themselves or the culture. For example, let’s take the issue of abortion. If feminism is a movement to end sexist oppression, and depriving females of reproductive rights is a form of sexist oppression, then one cannot be anti-choice and be feminist. A woman can insist she would never choose to have an abortion while affirming her support of the right of women to choose and still be an advocate of feminist politics. She cannot be anti-abortion and an advocate of feminism. Concurrently there can be no such thing as “power feminism” if the vision of power evoked is power gained through the exploitation and oppression of others.

Feminist politics is losing momentum because feminist movement has lost clear definitions. We have those definitions. Let’s reclaim them. Let’s share them. Let’s start over. Let’s have T-shirts and bumper stickers and postcards and hip-hop music, television and radio commercials, ads everywhere and billboards, and all manner of printed material that tells the world about feminism. We can share the simple yet powerful message that feminism is a movement to end sexist oppression. Let’s start there. Let the movement begin again.""",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,"Hooked on bell hooks, part 2: ""Feminist politics - where we stand"" (from ""Feminism is for everybody"", 2000)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/74ekcz/hooked_on_bell_hooks_part_2_feminist_politics/

""**Consciousness-raising: A Constant Change of Heart**

Feminists are made, not born. One does not become an advocate of feminist politics simply by having the privilege of having been born female. Like all political positions one becomes a believer in feminist politics through choice and action. When women first organized in groups to talk together about the issue of sexism and male domination, they were clear that females were as socialized to believe sexist thinking and values as males, the difference being simply that males benefited from sexism more than females and were as a consequence less likely to want to surrender patriarchal privilege. Before women could change patriarchy we had to change ourselves; we had to raise our consciousness.

Revolutionary feminist consciousness-raising emphasized the importance of learning about patriarchy as a system of domination, how it became institutionalized and how it is perpetuated and maintained. Understanding the way male domination and sexism was expressed in everyday life created awareness in women of the ways we were victimized, exploited, and, in worse case scenarios, oppressed. Early on in contemporary feminist movement, consciousness-raising groups often became settings where women simply unleashed pent-up hostility and rage about being victimized, with little or no focus on strategies of intervention and transformation. On a basic level many hurt and exploited women used the consciousness-raising group therapeutically. It was the site where they uncovered and openly revealed the depths of their intimate wounds. This confessional aspect served as a healing ritual. Through consciousness-raising women gained the strength to challenge patriarchal forces at work and at home.

Importantly though, the foundation of this work began with women examining sexist thinking and creating strategies where we would change our attitudes and belief via a conversion to feminist thinking and a commitment to feminist politics. Fundamentally, the consciousness-raising (CR) group was a site for conversion. To build a mass-based feminist movement women needed to organize. The consciousness-raising session, which usually took place in someone’s home (rather than public space that had to be rented or donated), was the meeting place. It was the place where seasoned feminist thinkers and activists could recruit new converts. Importantly, communication and dialogue was a central agenda at the consciousness-raising sessions. In many groups a policy was in place which honored everyone’s voice. Women took turns speaking to make sure everyone would be heard. This attempt to create a non-hierarchal model for discussion positively gave every woman a chance to speak but often did not create a context for engaged dialogue. However, in most instances discussion and debate occurred, usually after everyone had spoken at least once.

Argumentative discussion was common in CR groups as it was the way we sought to clarify our collective understanding of the nature of male domination. Only through discussion and disagreement could we begin to find a realistic standpoint on gender exploitation and oppression.

As feminist thinking, which emerged first in the context of small groups where individuals often knew each other (they may have worked together and/ or were friends), began to be theorized in printed matter so as to reach a wider audience, groups dismantled. The creation of women’s studies as an academic discipline provided another setting where women could be informed about feminist thinking and feminist theory. Many of the women who spearheaded the introduction of women’s studies classes into colleges and universities had been radical activists in civil rights struggles, gay rights, and early feminist movement. Many of them did not have doctorates, which meant that they entered academic institutions receiving lower pay and working longer hours than their colleagues in other disciplines. By the time younger graduate students joined the effort to legitimize feminist scholarship in the academy we knew that it was important to gain higher degrees. Most of us saw our commitment to women’s studies as political action; we were prepared to sacrifice in order to create an academic base for feminist movement.

By the late ‘70s women’s studies was on its way to becoming an accepted academic discipline. This triumph overshadowed the fact that many of the women who had paved the way for the institutionalization of women’s studies were fired because they had master’s degrees and not doctorates. While some of us returned to graduate school to get PhDs, some of the best and brightest among us did not because they were utterly disillusioned with the university and burnt out from overwork as well as disappointed and enraged that the radical politics undergirding women’s studies was being replaced by liberal reformism. Before too long the women’s studies classroom had replaced the free-for-all consciousness-raising group.

Whereas women from various backgrounds, those who worked solely as housewives or in service jobs, and big-time professional women, could be found in diverse consciousness-raising groups, the academy was and remains a site of class privilege. Privileged white middle-class women who were a numeric majority though not necessarily the radical leaders of contemporary feminist movement often gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle. Women with revolutionary feminist consciousness, many of them lesbian and from working-class backgrounds, often lost visibility as the movement received mainstream attention. Their displacement became complete once women’s studies became entrenched in colleges and universities which are conservative corporate structures. Once the women’s studies classroom replaced the consciousness-raising group as the primary site for the transmission of feminist thinking and strategies for social change the movement lost its mass-based potential.

Suddenly more and more women began to either call themselves “feminists” or use the rhetoric of gender discrimination to change their economic status. The institutionalization of feminist studies created a body of jobs both in the world of the academy and in the world of publishing. These careerbased changes led to forms of career opportunism wherein women who had never been politically committed to mass-based feminist struggle adopted the stance and jargon of feminism when it enhanced their class mobility. The dismantling of consciousness-raising groups all but erased the notion that one had to learn about feminism and make an informed choice about embracing feminist politics to become a feminist advocate.

Without the consciousness-raising group as a site where women confronted their own sexism towards other women, the direction of feminist movement could shift to a focus on equality in the workforce and confronting male domination. With heightened focus on the construction of woman as a “victim” of gender equality deserving of reparations (whether through changes in discriminatory laws or affirmative action policies) the idea that women needed to first confront their internalized sexism as part of becoming feminist lost currency. Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING 11ten gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle.

Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make one a “feminist.” Without confronting internalized sexism women who picked up the feminist banner often betrayed the cause in their interactions with other women.

By the early ‘80s the evocation of a politicized sisterhood, so crucial at the onset of the feminist movement, lost meaning as the terrain of radical feminist politics was overshadowed by a lifestyle based feminism which suggested any woman could be a feminist no matter what her political beliefs. Needless to say such thinking has undermined feminist theory and practice, feminist politics. When feminist movement renews itself, reinforcing again and again the strategies that will enable a mass movement to end sexism and sexist exploitation and oppression for everyone, consciousness-raising will once again attain its original importance. Effectively imitating the model of AA meetings, feminist consciousness-raising groups will take place in communities, offering the message of feminist thinking to everyone irrespective of class, race, or gender. While specific groups based on shared identities might emerge, at the end of every month individuals would be in mixed groups.

Feminist consciousness-raising for males is as essential to revolutionary movement as female groups. Had there been an emphasis on groups for males that taught boys and men about what sexism is and how it can be transformed, it would have been impossible for mass media to portray the movement as anti-male. It would also have preempted the formation of an anti-feminist men’s movement. Often men’s groups were formed in the wake of contemporary feminism that in no way addressed the issues of sexism and male domination. Like the lifestyle-based feminism aimed at women these groups often became therapeutic settings for men to confront their wounds without a critique of patriarchy or a platform of resistance to male domination. Future feminist movement will not make this mistake. Males of all ages need settings where their resistance to sexism is affirmed and valued. Without males as allies in struggle feminist movement will not progress. As it is we have to do so much work to correct the assumption deeply embedded in the cultural psyche that feminism is anti-male. Feminism is anti-sexism. A male who has divested of male privilege, who has embraced feminist politics, is a worthy comrade in struggle, in no way a threat to feminism, whereas a female who remains wedded to sexist thinking and behavior infiltrating feminist movement is a dangerous threat. Significantly, the most powerful intervention made by consciousness-raising groups was the demand that all females confront their internalized sexism, their allegiance to patriarchal thinking and action, and their commitment to feminist conversion. That intervention is still needed. It remains the necessary step for anyone choosing feminist politics. The enemy within must be transformed before we can confront the enemy outside. The threat, the enemy, is sexist thought and behavior. **As long as females take up the banner of feminist politics without addressing and transforming their own sexism, ultimately the movement will be undermined**.""",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,"Hooked on bell hooks, part 3: ""Consciousness-raising: a constant change of heart"" (from ""Feminism is for everybody"", 2000)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/74m085/hooked_on_bell_hooks_part_3_consciousnessraising/

I'm going to address 3 to 4 reasons why I have a problem with these arguments. If you disagree, feel free to comment, this post's purpose is for a discussion for different view points.

Though in no particular order, the first most common argument I hear is, 'I'm not a feminist because I'm not...' and they would make reference to the feminists they don't like, be it the red haired lady, the 'triggered' lady so on and so forth. I find this problematic because, why dissociate oneself from a movement you care about just because there are people you don't like who are in the movement or what have you. I say three to four points because this point often gets tied into 'what is feminism' and while I have my view on what feminism is, too many ignore the multiple viewpoints of what feminism is and only put what they believe as feminism, 'ie man hating', as the truth of feminism. 

The second is the notion that 'we don't need feminism in the west'. Granted, this is based on my experience, but those who claim feminism isn't needed in the west often say they don't see the need because 'misogyny doesn't exist'. 'I am all for women working,' or 'I love a strong women' so on and so forth. What they fail to realize, is that though it may be true for them, and perhaps for their demographic, such as where they live etc. etc. doesn't mean that misogyny doesn't exist. 

Thirdly, a common argument people make is 'why not simply egalitarian'. This I don't have a problem with in it and of itself, but sometimes when I talk about feminist issues, it turns into a 'who is more oppressed discussion'. It also devolves into a 'male privilege' issue. People get defensive about male privilege, claiming 'well I grew up poor' etc. as if male privilege is a bad thing. 

Lastly, those who claim they are not a feminist because of biology. ""Women should not go into military because of biology. women are weaker, or even, men cannot function properly when a women is around"". Not only do I disagree with this factual statement, but the key issue I want to talk about is, 'are we really slaves to are biology'? For example, even if it's true that 'men cannot function properly around women', I am sure we can train ourselves to go beyond. Look at monks who meditate days without food. (Though I don't think it's healthy, that's besides the point.) The point is, we most definitely can ignore our biology, in my opinion. 

On a side note, there are people who say 'no one says this and that' which is again problematic or 'well that's not the majority. the majority doesn't think xyz religious fanatic thoughts'. Majority or not, they do exist, and I think by ignoring it or saying 'we anti feminists aren't like this' is the same thing as my first point.

Thank you for the read. For those who agree with me, what are your experiences like? For those who disagree, again, let me know your thoughts. ",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,"Against ""Why I am not a feminist...""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/74o89v/against_why_i_am_not_a_feminist/

I was an active kid and would get jealous of boys and men who, after hours of play or work, took off their shirts and sometimes even tied them like sweatbands around their heads. As a teenager, I was never allowed to take off my bra, much less my shirt on scorching hot days and I've always resented that.

For the last couple of years, my husband and I have been living in a relatively small but very socially liberal town. Women face no legal repercussions for nude breasts here even though it's extremely rarely seen. I've tried to talk to my husband about the possibility of going shirtless, not often or for attention, but out of comfort on hot 90+ degree days, and partly out of principle for what I was never able to do when I was younger.

My husband basically told me that if someone ever saw me doing that, it would reflect badly on him, as people in his profession are very conservative. He also said that if his friends ever saw me, it would embarrass him and that he doesn't want his friends seeing my boobs. The latter part sort of hurts me because it's sad to hear my own husband reinforcing the ideas that kept me from doing a lot of things in my life. I used to get so tired of being told what I should and shouldn't be doing as a ""young lady"". Now I feel like I'm being told what I should and shouldn't do because I'm a woman and I have my husband (and his career and feelings) to think about. I know this is a pretty small ordeal, but for me, it's representative of a lot of things I'll never get to do. As a kid I thought I was going to grow up to be a boxer or a race car driver but I wasn't even allowed to have a model car or go on fishing trips with my uncles who, for years, have been too ""busy"" to teach me carpentry all the while struggling in vain to get the boys in my family interested. I just want to do something to make me feel that much less restricted by my gender but at the same time, I don't want to do anything that could potentially damage my husband's quality of life. Am I being selfish or making a big deal out of nothing?

This article discusses gender relations and the sexual division of labor in the countryside, in dialogue with the social action “Marcha das Margaridas”. Having as research subjects countryside women from the north of Minas Gerais State, participants of the “Marcha”, by means of participant observation, interviews and informal conversations, sought to unveil the sexism present in labor relations in the countryside and the changes that occurred in the social practice and the worldview of these women. The findings reveal that, despite the situations of inequalities and invisibility of women in the countryside labor - with the persistence of ""multiple tasks"", participation and engagement in feminist and countryside social actions such as The “Marcha das Margaridas”, have contributed to the breakdown of paradigms rooted in society.

It's a very common occurrance that among adults men are called ""men"" and women are called ""girls"". Why do people use a word that's meant to be used for female children when they talk about adult women? It even happens that ""man"" and ""girl"" are used in the same sentence when both persons that are being discussed are adults. At least to me it feels almost patronizing, as if a woman isn't adult enough to actually get called a woman, so she gets called a girl. And I know some people use it as a sort of endearing term, like the commong thing in movies where a charming man saying ""hi girls"" when he walks into a room and all the women sort of giggle and look coyly at him. But really, calling an adult a girl is a bit weird because the word girl carries with it some connotations, like naïvety and childish innocence, that I wouldn't really see as suitable for a grown woman.

Another similar thing I've noticed is that when talking about famous people, men are most often spoken about using their last name, while women are often spoken about using their first name. I've most often seen this in my studies (comparative literature) where many female authors are spoken of using their first name while for male authors their last names are used. Why is this? Personally I believe it's because there's a tendency to make men seem more professional, which using their last name enforces, and women are made to seem softer and more approachable, so their first names are used.

While this are pretty small issues compared to things like violence and discrimination towards women, language does affect how we think and behave. And because of that it annoys me when grown women are called girls. We are not children, we are women.",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,You know what really annoys me?

I wanted to let you know about an initiative in Edinburgh, Scotland, during this year's campaign on the 16 Days of Action on Gender Based Violence. I have teamed up with a group of people with a passion to eradicate Violence Against Women and Girls and we are planning, organising and co-ordinating at least one event per day during the 16 days (November 25th to December 10th). 

This initiative is hugely important because:
- there has never been a city-wide initiative like this before in Scotland (or in fact the UK).
- events will include art exhibitions, seminars, conferences, film screenings, talks and workshops among others
- events will be for everyone who wishes to be involved, from all communities and walks of life
- discussions will include: sexual abuse/harassment; domestic abuse; mental health; female genital mutilation/cutting; child protection; forced marriage/child marriage; gender justice; slavery and human trafficking among others
- most importantly, these events are being planned on a budget of exactly £0. Partners have kindly contributed their own time/skills/energy/talent/resources in order for these event to take place, and the aim was that when men and women work together peacefully and collaboratively, great things can be achieved. 

Please take a moment to check our website: http://16days.org.uk/ and our blog: 16daysofempowerment.wordpress.com to see what is happening. Please post your (constructive) feedback and we look forward to hearing from you!

Every post he makes drives me crazy for it's genereal lack of factual relivence. Here is is post about the recent Boy Scout/ Girls news.

""A quick note on the Boy Scouts deciding to remove any remaining reason for their own existence by admitting girls.
Many people have told me that this is good and fair because the Boy Scouts offers the opportunity to do things that girls can't do in Girl Scouts. I don't know if that's true or not, but it's completely irrelevant.
Here's a crazy idea: maybe not everything in society needs to be centered around giving opportunities to girls. Maybe not everything is about girls always. Maybe some things are about boys and for boys. Or used to be, anyway. It's OK for boys to have their own spaces. It's OK for boys to do their own thing sometimes. Or it used to be, anyway.
Boy Scouts are supposed to be for boys. That's the whole point. It's right in the name of the organization. Boy Scouts were meant to help boys become men. Girls don't need help becoming men because they're girls.
This may be a scandalous notion for feminists, but guess what? Sometimes boys like to just be around other boys and have the kind of male bonding that is simply not possible if girls are forced into the mix. And this bonding is important. It's essential to the healthy formation of boys.
I know there are girl who like to say, ""I'm just one of the guys, really."" But you're not. You're not one of the guys anymore than I'm one of the girls. Maybe you like camping and sports and whatever else, but that doesn't make you a boy, nor does it entitle you to intrude into every single male space or male gathering.
And we wonder why our boys are struggling so much. They're growing up with the impression that there's nothing special or unique about boyhood, and their desire to just be with the guys sometimes is wrong and bigoted. They're made to hate themselves and forced to bond with girls in a way that's unnatural and unfulfilling, pretending that they see the girls just as they see other boys. It's confusing, degrading, and unfair.
Meanwhile, girls can still have their own spaces. Except for the locker room. Boys can go there. Because nothing makes sense in our ridiculous culture.""

I'm going to preface this post by disclaiming that I am not at *all* a member or adherent of any ""feminist"" group or ideology per se; I absolutely believe in equal opportunities for all human beings, but my current perspective on ""Feminism proper"" has been shaped by public episodes of social zealotry (e.g. the whole [""Mattress Girl"" farce](https://www.mrctv.org/blog/mattress-girl-breaks-pornography-accuses-viewers-participating-rape)) that make the current, Western manifestation of the movement seem more like a modern cult than an actual civil rights crusade.

My worldview aside, in light of recent controversies surrounding the scumbag Weinstein and his serial molestation/raping of women around him, I'd like this Subreddit's help in dissecting some of the language that is brewing in social media circles regarding the whole thing.

More specifically, there was a hashtag trending on Twitter that asked people (or maybe just women?) to describe times in their life when they had to overcome ""their own Harvey Weinstein"", i.e. sexual predators holding powerful positions in their lives. The stories were disturbingly commonplace and eerily familiar: some sort of employer or family member inevitably forcing victims to participate in unwanted massages (or worse), and victims being unable to react for fear of financial or physical backlash.

One of the narratives arising from this hashtag was women being outraged by us men not doing more: essentially a call for us to ""step up"" and stop shielding criminals behind some sort of ""bro-code"" that normalized rapist behavior as a natural consequence of our testosterone or whatever. I didn't really understand the logic behind those accusations, but I figured the people leveling them weren't being malicious in doing so, and so I offered my two cents on the matter to add a slightly dissenting opinion to the mix.

One of the ideas I raised online was subsidized self-defense classes for people across the nation, similar to how earthquake or tornado-preparation drills are provided by the government as a free service to its citizens (I actually remember being part of something like this in 7th grade, but those ""lessons"" were *way* too short and absolutely worthless, outdated crap by modern standards). My idea was to have MMA fighters like Bas Rutten and Ronda Rousey contracted by the government to offer practical, real-world tips on how somebody (especially with lighter bodyweight and/or confined surroundings) could make the most of any situation, and upload these tutorials as a free resource for anyone to learn at home. It wouldn't be a perfect solution by any means, but simply a small step towards ensuring the social footprint of sexual violence becoming as small as possible.

To my shock, immediately I was accused of ""victim-blaming"" because I was supposedly placing the burden of action on women, when instead I should be suffocating ""rape culture"" by doing ... I'm not exactly sure what, to be honest. Admonishing aspiring rapists not to rape, and simply hoping for the best? Advocating for random searches of men on the street to make sure they weren't packing date-rape drugs? Pre-emptively jailing men with abnormally high testosterone levels as a safety precaution?

See, here's where I start to not understand the whole backlash against supposed ""victim-blaming"": I'm a huge fan of martial arts, and one of the core tenets of basically any art is sufficient preparation for the world around you; this is because it's essentially taken for granted that there will *always* be criminals out there, and since you can't snuff out their existence entirely, you can at least take steps to ensure their eventual effect on the world is as *minimal* as possible. Yes, it's also a relatively violent outlook by conventional Western standards, but as a personal believer in the death penalty for rapists of any age and gender, I've pretty much ""drawn my line in the sand"" on that issue.

The online discussions devolved into bickering not long after that, but a retort I wish I followed up with was ""if victim-blaming is a thing, then why do modern homes come with door-locks installed? Is it smart to shift the narrative away from locking doors or cars, and start focusing instead on how we can stop 'burglar culture' from violating people's privacy?"" Forgive me if I'm wrong, but ""stop expecting *women* to do something about sexual violence!"" sounds a *lot* to me like ""until criminals stop being criminals, we feminists are okay with women being exposed to *as* much risk as statistically possible"".

Don't get me wrong, nobody is claiming that self-defense classes are magically going to eradicate all rape, or that all attackers are unrelated strangers to each victim, or even that self-defense lessons are *guaranteed* to help you in an assault situation. All I'm wondering at is the wisdom of ""the philosophy of female inaction"", which in this particular context sounds a *lot* like the very same ""damsel-in-distress"" worldview that modern feminism takes a public stance *against*: the crusade against ""victim-blaming"" seems to imply that women are helpless in doing something against sexual violence, and must rely entirely on the goodwill and action of men in order for this problem to be overcome.

I appreciate any and all opinions on the matter at hand, and although I don't expect to find common ground with the majority of people in this Sub, I can at least feel better knowing that I tried to learn something I didn't know before.

Cheers, mates

**Edit:** Here are some articles that share my particular opinion, and I'm wondering whether the people of this Sub agree with them (or why they don't) - [I](https://www.newstatesman.com/society/2014/06/suggesting-women-learn-self-defence-opposite-victim-blaming) [II](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/i-dont-believe-selfdefence-training-is-victim-blaming-and-im-a-feminist/news-story/c84cfbdbf94430344f9647894dacb345) [III](https://everydayfeminism.com/2014/07/self-defense-blame-victims/) [IV](https://gendersociety.wordpress.com/2014/06/09/empowering-women-not-just-protecting-them/)

It's a math class, and it's condensed. I'm listening to the lecture when the teacher starts to describe a function. He starts to talk about domain and range, and how they relate. I have backed it up and listened to it several times. He says something about how if you are x, the domain, and your friends are the range, y, that's a relationship. But it's not a function. A function would be if you were x, and your very best friend was y. Then he says, ""Write down the name of your very best friend. I know some of you ladies have your 3 'BFFs'. That's really a lie you can only ever have one best, now maybe it depends on your mood and it changes day to day, but there's only one best."" It 'feels' lighthearted, but it's weirdly a lot of info for a throwaway comment. There is a laugh murmur heard (the lecture is the teacher/class audio with the visual being whatever tech he uses to display the text and his instructions). He's youngish (maybe 30s-40s?), and talks like he's ""the cool teacher"". I think he's said, ""baked your noodle"" like 18 times in 3 hours. Not sure if it's his age showing or he's really into The Matrix. But I'm not 18 and I feel like I recognize misogyny when I hear it. I asked a friend about it (did share the lecture with her, b/c I trust her to keep it to herself), she agrees with me. 

Do I do something about it? What do I do? I have like 2.5 hours of lecture still to go. And in the first 3 hours, this was the first thing I've heard like this.

Also, he's the only teacher I have (of 5 teachers, and correspondence with at least 2 other people from the school for tutoring stuff) that displays the ""All correspondence is subject to local public records laws..."" which just weirds me out.

And while I think that is valuable, I really just right now need to hear from the people who already share my frustration with patriarchy and who are already feminists. How do you cope?

Here's my question/anecdote/rant. Sorry in advance that it's stupid, but I just hit a weird breaking point over something minor, and I'm really thinking to myself, how do I get on??

I just don't know how to take it anymore. This is stupid, but I just got back from seeing Blade Runner with my boyfriend and another couple. I don't care to talk about the movie right now, but it's full of really misogynistic scenes- literally every scene that includes a woman character. I kept trying to ignore it and get into the film, but the misogyny just kept pulling me out of it, and it's so long. By the end I was just so ready for it to be over so we could get on with our lives.

As soon as the film was over, the other woman said something that made me realize she felt the same way I did so we laughed and ranted a bit about what a misogynistic film it was. Our two partners agreed with us, but they said mostly it didn't bother them and they were able to enjoy the film. We dropped it at that.

Later at home and after a few drinks, I started to think about it again, and I asked my bf how he could've enjoyed the film or not noticed all the things I noticed. He said he noticed some of them but was mostly wrapped up in the film and not interested in analyzing it from a feminist point of view. I said I wasn't either (I seriously wasnt) but that the movie kept pulling me out of it by showing something awful and misogynistic every single scene so I couldn't just relax and stop thinking about it. He said he didn't feel this way and couldn't relate. Because my partner is black, I tried to personalize it. I said, what if every single scene that involved a black character, they were playing around with some terrible racist stereotype like wearing black face and eating watermelon- something just blatant and bigoted like that. Would he have been able to just ignore that or not notice and instead enjoy the film? He says no, he hadn't thought of it that way. But the point is of course that he didn't.

This is a really minor thing, and who cares right? But I'm having trouble shaking how depressed it's gotten me. And it's not about a stupid movie night. All the shit that is going on right now- the fight for coverage of birth control like any other drug, the fight for abortion access, the politicians lately who've said men shouldn't have to contribute to insurance coverage for prenatal care, the high maternal mortality rate among women of color, the current detention of pregnant immigrants and prevention of some of them to receive health care, the expiration of CHIP, assholes misogynists like our current president and administration, the Weinstein shit, cases like that Brock Turner asshole, it's like it just never stops. And then when I'm out and about in real life with decent men that I care about who are feminists, they don't even notice that a movie that revolves around sex bot housewife servants and defining human by the ability to reproduce and several scenes in which they slice open uteruses and discuss violent death in childbirth, they aren't even troubled enough to notice that it's really disturbing and misogynistic?

I feel like it's the straw that breaks the camel's back- it's not a serious thing. I know it's some flippant bullshit. But I feel like I just can't get on anymore. How do you cope?

The same year, men started noticing me and catcalling.

When I was 11, a man exposed his penis to me in the women's shoe aisle of my local Walmart. My mom and little sister were in the next aisle. They shut the store down, but they couldn't find him. I made a police report. The policeman asked me a lot of questions about the penis. I didn't know how to answer because I had never seen one before.

Later that year, a man touched my ass in the mayonnaise aisle at the grocery store. I didn't say anything because I wasn't sure if it was an accident and I knew that it wouldn't matter.

I spent the majority of that same year having my bra strap snapped and being called ""stuffer"" by many of the boys in my sixth grade honors program. I switched schools again.

When I was 16, I went on a trip to Europe. I was in Belgium, in a crowd waiting to receive Queen Elizabeth of England and Queen Paola of Belgium. An older Belgian man offered to let me stand in front of him, at the front of the crowd. He then put his hands on my vagina. I froze, not knowing what to do. As I looked around for help, my eyes found Nathan, another boy on my trip. He was laughing. I just stayed where I was. When we left the crowd, I was pulled aside by the adult chaperones. Apparently Nathan had told. The women grilled me, asking me why I didn't move, why I had allowed the man to touch me, etc. ""I didn't,"" I said. What I had meant to say was that I was scared.

I spent much of my young adulthood engaged in an abusive relationship. This is more painful, both because it's more fresh, but also because it wasn't a stranger. It was someone I loved and trusted. I endured the constant emotional, frequent physical, and occasional sexual abuse - until I didn't. I don't know why I did. I don't know what made me ultimately end it. But when I did, I didn't say anything. And when I finally did say something, no one believed me. But eventually other women began to ask me about him.

I am a computer science student from Germany. I'm currently working on my bachelors thesis in which I use machine learning to analyse Reddit. In my analysis I want to cluster Subreddits into topics (politics, food, science, gender-discussions, ...) and then through something called word embedding I want to check which of those topics are rather male dominated and which are female dominated. If everything works, this will make space for further stereotype critical research. Enough of explanation on my thesis, here's my question:


Can anyone help me out with scientifical papers or other sources on gender stereotypes or gender distributions in these miscellaneous topics? I would love to have some work from sociology stating that for example ""Discussions on politics in internet forums are much more male dominated as opposed to discussions on ecology or food, which are female dominated.""",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,Help with my bachelors thesis on gender stereotypes in Reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/76y5o6/help_with_my_bachelors_thesis_on_gender/

Me too. It's true. I too have been a victim. I also chose not to participate in this viral Facebook meme, and for good reason: silent protest. 

That's right. I don't need your likes or hearts or cries, or even your angry faces. I am a victim, and I would rather keep my story private. 

Please don't get me wrong. A LOT if good has come out of this. People who have pent up rage have a sudden and somewhat open invitation to purge their experience. GREAT! 

Some people must still stay silent. There are victims right now who are torn. If they say ""me too,"" too, their partner, ex, stalker, etc. (no, I did not assume the gender of the victim or perpetrator) may see it and retaliate. I fear that these individuals are feeling pressure to be strong. ""If you don't speak up, you are not strong enough. You are weak. You are a part of the problem."" No they aren't. They are victims. Just like you. Me too.

Honestly, I'm torn too. Yes, me too. On one hand, this is wide scale victim shaming. One victim could come out and endure retaliation or worse. On the other, it is a great opportunity for some victims to finally get off their chest what has plagued them and finally, if ever, feel a sense of freedom. 

The problem is that victims, all of us, only have two hands. On one hand; say something. On the other hand; don't. Make the decision that will keep you safe. Don't feel pressured to say anything that will hurt you. Clearly, there are many victims that are willing to speak up for you. We are with you, and, I dare say we are not in it for the ""likes"" or ""hopes and prayers.""

My hope and prayer for all of you is that you are safe, happy, and know that you have support somewhere. Yes, you do. Me too.

Today, a guy I'm friends with on facebook posted a status saying that the hashtag has gotten the point across already, so we should instead use his own proposition of a hashtag - #IHave. As in, ""#ihave met a kind gentleman who stood up for me"" or ""#ihave helped a girl out of a sexual predator situation"". This, he says, is meant to illustrate a ""more positive view of the matter"", because ""not everything needs to be negative"". 

It's been a couple of days, and he is already saying, ""I get the point, but not all men""? Obviously we've all met nice people. This is nothing special. I don't see how this helps. 

I commented on his post with the above paragraph, and another man responded to my comment, saying, ""Actually, given the awful messages young boys receive about themselves as an ongoing social rhetoric, I say it needs serious awareness"". 

That's kinda the point that got to me the most. So this counter-hashtag is a) meant to distract us from the negative in order to congratulate the men who have been our saviours and b) make men feel better about themselves. 

I do agree that the unique issues men face need serious awareness. But this is not the time nor place. Making a rebuttal against the #metoo posts under the guise of ""being positive"" doesn't sound like support to me... it sounds more like dismissal and not wanting to face the severity of the issues which sparked the #metoo hashtag. It sounds like yet another ""not all men"". In fact, I don't see how it is relevant at all... why must ""I too have been sexually harassed and I stand in solidarity with all those who have"" be immediately met with ""Yeah okay, but some guys are good, like me!!! Make sure everyone knows!"" 

Is it just me??

While that world could be full of amazing opportunities, its history is marred by an track record of systematic, widespread inequality directed at women:

&amp;nbsp;

Women still make far less than their male counterparts. Female incarceration rates have skyrocketed. Our foster care system is in need of a major overhaul and is, all too often, used as a pipeline to sex trafficking for women and young girls. From Cosby to Weinstein, one look at the news today will show you how prevalent sexual assault is in our society. Police departments nationwide are woefully undertrained to handle domestic violence situations and the courts often don’t enforce standards fairly in urban and rural areas. And of course, reproductive healthcare is under constant attack. Far from fading away into the history books, the war on women seems to be kicking into high gear.

&amp;nbsp;

Women’s rights are used as tokens daily, but their rights are not bargaining chips. Women must be represented as a whole, not through the lens of single issues.

&amp;nbsp;

They shouldn’t have to fight for access to birth control while corporations systematically employ wage discrimination policies aimed to increase corporate profits.

&amp;nbsp;

For my daughters, and all our daughters, there is hope on the horizon. We must fight for the future they will inherit.

&amp;nbsp;

The Equal Rights Amendment has never been ratified - meaning women have no guarantee of equal protection under the Constitution. But it’s close. Only two states remain for its passage. What’s more: there’s precedent for a long, but successful, ratification. The 27th Amendment took more than 200 years to pass!

&amp;nbsp;

The ERA will not solve all our problems, but it would be a giant boost of momentum to help guarantee a world where our mothers, sisters, wives, daughters and friends are treated with equal respect, dignity and opportunity under the law. In Congress, I will fight to ensure its passage.

&amp;nbsp;

Look for documentary screenings, town halls, blog submissions and videos and join us as we further the fight for women's rights. Through education and sharing experiences, we can make our policymakers and our President see that women’s rights are, in fact, human rights.

&amp;nbsp;

In Solidarity,

My friend and I, both feminists who have experienced sexual harassment and assault, have very different ideas on the campaign.

While I think the campaign has it's issues, and puts undue pressure on the victim to share their stories, I've also seem some very moving stories and posts. I've seen a lot of writing that goes beyond ""sharing a story"" and gives lots of insight into victim blaming, supporting victims of assault, how to help women (or anyone else!) who you see being harassed, and how to curb problematic behavior or thoughts you might have and understand others perspectives. I also have seem some great articles that the campaign has spurred with facts, stats, and further information about harassment and assault in the US and how society can work to prevent violence, get bad people out of positions of power, and in general be a better support system for survivors.

My friend on the other hand hates this campaign. She believes it is ridiculous and that men shouldn't need to see stories and hashtags on their feed to understand the problem the country has with harassment and assault. She also thinks the campaign is not inclusive: while it is now being posted and used by men and members of the LGBT community, it was originally intended for women writing about harassment they experienced at the hands of men. At the end of the day, she thinks having women recount their stories does more harm than good and won't change the opinions of anyone.

I don't necessarily think that either of us is right or wrong, or that there is an definitive answer of whether this campaign ""works."" I really just would love to hear what your thoughts are and if you think the campaign is positive, negative, helpful, or harmful.

I'm Cora. I'm an artist and writer currently working on a zine about sexual harassment in the workplace, and am seeking relevant personal stories to share in the zine. I want to hear your answers to this question: ""How has workplace sexual harassment affected you?"" 

HOW TO SHARE YOUR STORY

I know this is a sensitive and painful subject, and I appreciate so much that you are willing to talk about it. Let me know how I can best respect your needs in this. I'm happy to answer any questions you have. The format is quite open-ended—write a few sentences or several paragraphs, and include whatever level of detail you're comfortable with. All stories included in the zine will be shared on a strictly anonymous basis, no names of any kind will be attached. Feel free to either answer the question in comments, or send me a private message if that's more comfortable. I reserve the right to leave out any stories that don't seem appropriate for the work, although I don't imagine I'll want to. Anyone who contributes to the zine and would like a free copy will get one (I'll contact you when it's complete to ask for a mailing address).

MORE INFO ABOUT THE PROJECT

Because of a harassment complaint and subsequent backlash from my previous employer earlier this year, I ended up doing a lot of research around sexual harassment. I also had a lot of friends reach out to me with stories of their own harassment. I was horrified to realize that the problem is much more rampant than I'd known, particularly in the restaurant industry. I learned a lot about how to navigate these situations in the future, but was very concerned by how difficult it was for me to find that information—I want to make it more accessible to more people. I want to create a guide on sexual harassment that is engaging and personal and realistic, one that's super cheap to produce and distribute, one that is quick and easy to read (instead of a daunting wall of legal jargon). The zine will be about how to navigate harassment situations, but I'd also like a large portion of it to be personal stories from people like you, that shed light on the magnitude of the problem and its many faces. I've been struggling to find the time and energy for this project for months. The recent #MeToo posts from my friends have rekindled my creative fury and reminded me of why this is so important.

Please note that there is no length, or level of severity, or any other qualification that your story needs to meet in order to be valuable for this. If it didn't happen to you but is something you witnessed or helped someone else through, even if you don't know whether it legally counts as sexual harassment—if it feels relevant and you feel compelled to share, then I would love to hear from you.

Thanks so much for reading this and for your help with this project!

They should cast parts based on the ability to play the part, both in acting ability and in believability for the part (you can't cast someone in their 40s to play a teenager, for example).  Other legitimate factors are availability – the actor cannot have another time commitment for another project during the filming schedule.  These are all legitimate casting concerns.  What should NOT be a casting concern is willingness to engage in sex with the producer, the director, the casting specialist, etc.  

For years, I've preferred independent and foreign films because they often offer better quality films than Hollywood ones.  However, the casting couch in Hollywood has long been another concern.  The casting couch also negatively affects the quality of films because then they may not cast based on who is actually best for the part.  This is why I'm frankly not at all surprised at the scandal involving Harvey Weinstein.  He's a symptom of the problem, not the cause.  Fundamental change in Hollywood is needed, not just the ousting of Weinstein.  Without fundamental change toward a system based on acting merit, the casting couch will continue, which will negatively affect the careers of actors and the quality of films.  

Is there something you the film consumer can do about this?  Yes, there is.  You can support independent and foreign films.  There are high quality films out there that get overlooked.  I started watching French films to help me learn to speak French.  To my delight, I found that France creates some very high quality films.  I don't mind reading subtitles.  And with my French improving, sometimes I don't have to.  Of course, if it turns out that France also has a casting couch, I'll be very disappointed.  I hope not.  

I do not have a high level of confidence that Hollywood will clean up its act, but I guess it's possible.  ",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,Casting couch in Hollywood,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/777jxv/casting_couch_in_hollywood/

As a senior, I chose psychology as my second semester elective. The instructor was an alumni, been teaching a few years after 20+ years in law, and well regarded in the school/entire community because he was also the football coach. His son was a student in my year. To the football team, he was not only Coach, he was also their best friend's/teammate's dad. People hung out at this guy's house. This teacher was also my home room teacher all year. He knew exactly what rules to break to make him popular as a teacher--never marked you late no matter what time you strolled in, let you do homework, and didn't care if your shirt was tucked in. Every female was ""sweetheart"". He gave every male a personal nickname. He was very dad-like. 

Second semester, day one of his class, he shut the door and it started. Basically, we were told that what happened in that class, stayed in that class. We were going to talk about things that the ""boss"" wouldn't like--sex, drugs, rock and roll type things. He set up an ""us"" against ""them"" mentality really early. He told us we were going to get really close. He made it clear that if you weren't going to be cool about it, you needed to drop the class. Then, he specifically stated: ""if i ever make you uncomfortable, come to me and we'll work it out, don't get an administrator involved and ruin it for everyone else"". He started slow: making stupid sex jokes, telling us about his glory days as a lawyer in the 80s, making comments here and there about women's bodies in general. Then the ""jokes"" got a little more graphic--throwing in lewd hand gestures. When we got to a lesson that included sexual harassment, he told us that sexual harassment doesn't happen anymore. Women routinely lie or exaggerate and it ruins men's careers. And when men do cross a line, it's because they don't know any better and women need to lighten up. In his unit on abnormal psychology, he thought it was important for us to know that ""some doctors"" say that homosexuality fits the criteria of a mental illness. About this time in the semester, his style of dress started to became more relaxed. He started wearing basketball shorts with no underwear rather than his usual khakis. This was a very small classroom so he was less than a foot away from you if you sat in front, which I did. He told us that he had ""friends"" that commented on how hot the girls were at our school. 

One day at lunch, sitting with 3 girls from my class, I worked up the courage to say, ""so Coach is like...a creep, right?"" The response was essentially ""yeah, you didn't know?"" He only taught 2 classes each semester. All seniors. He was a guaranteed A. That's how he got away with this shit. Nobody is going to rock the boat a few months before graduation and he knew it. Right before final exams we played his version of ""Girls ask Guys"". We were encouraged to ask ANYTHING, without embarrassment, because questions were going to go in a hat. What happens in class, stays in class, remember? We were graded on our discussion participation but we could say ""pass"". A lot of sex questions came up because we were all 17/18yr olds trying to play this demented man's game. We went around the room and were pressured to talk about sexual fantasies, masturbation habits, penis size etc. There was several days of this. Looking back, I think he humiliated us for his entertainment. This was in 2010. Last I checked, he is still teaching. Every word of this is true and I would testify in court if his day ever comes.

There will be provided links to professional help options. The whole website will be completely costless and safe from hate.

Rather, it's to share an experience in which I possibly participated in rape culture, and how I know I can improve.

Yesterday, one of my male coworkers brought up Harvey Weinstein to another coworker. I sat and listened. His take on the whole disgusting saga was that the ""hollywood liberals"" won't talk about sexual assault, but they're more than happy to talk about gun control. 

He said nothing about the victims, brushing them aside like their stories don't matter, and instead made the conversation about ""liberalism"" and his take on gun control.

In a matter of seconds, the victims were essentially silenced for something he thought was more important. Perhaps he did it subconsciously. I'm not sure. 

I'm still brand new in the office. This coworker in particular shares an office with me. We've only shared the room for three days. 

I was silently screaming at him and questioning myself. Should I say something? If I say something, will that potentially do long term damage to a professional relationship that's still in it's infancy? Will I potentially do harm to my new job? What can I say that will change his point of view that he's likely held for ages?

I sat in silence. Then, their conversation was over. My chance to make a minute difference was gone. And I chose to let it pass.

I realize that this kind of ""locker room talk"" only perpetuates the problem. I had a chance to speak up, and I didn't. The situation has been replaying in my brain for 24 hours. And now, I feel sick knowing that maybe, I could have said something to make him think differently. It would have been easy. ""Hey, what about the assault victims? Their stories matter."" 

And that could have been it. And I hate that I didn't speak up. Next time, I will. It's possible to have meaningful conversation and not damage professional relationships at the same time. 

It's just a small example, but change has to start somewhere. I can do better.

If you are sitting there wondering why the hell you would even attempt to find common ground with such toxic people, you may not have seen any of the several studies suggesting that people have extreme difficulty changing their views even in the light of clear opposing evidence. The only way around this issue, it seems, is to frame discussions in a way that lets your conversation partner know that you understand their beliefs/fears/complaints and you are on their side.

My wife and I found that the above method worked pretty well with a conspiracy theorist neighbor we had, but his crazy ideas now feel surprisingly tame compared to the dense web of negativity people like incels and MGTOW have gotten wrapped up in. It's much harder to find common ground with people who genuinely think half of the world population is basically trash.

That being said, there seems to be an obvious trend  (with members of these groups) of past romance clouding judgement, or failed interactions with women that have traumatized them for life. Do you think the start of helping these guys let go of all the hate and fear could be to relate to their own traumas somehow?

Can women even be involved in the discussion or will anything they say, no matter how reasonable, be construed as feminine trickery? Do you see any other way of getting through to these men?

I hope this was all a coherent read. Also, I'll try to find some articles on the subject of evidence rejection and bias and link to them later.

I am currently conducting research for my Anthropology thesis about the intersection of gender, teen cell phone use, and parental fear of the ""digital unknown."" From my research so far I see that parents are more likely to restrict and monitor teen girls on their phone and social media use than sons. Young women are also more likely to be harassed digitally and feel pressured to participate in sexual acts they may not be comfortable with. The combination of the two has led to young women feeling uncomfortable with their burgeoning sexualities. I believe this is a very relevant issue that is not getting enough attention. I would love to start a dialogue here to hear your opinions and experiences if you're willing to share.

Additionally, here is a link to a survey I wrote which is aimed at young adults who can recall high school and their experiences with cell phones during those years. Please feel free to share this with others (mostly in the U.S.) if you think they would like to share their thoughts. The survey is completely anonymous.

Overall I really want this to be an opportunity for women to share their experiences that were maybe difficult to deal with in high school. For me, it was the constant nagging for nude photographs from a few different boys that really drove me towards this subject. I have shared these experiences with others in hopes that it will inspire others to come forward (if comfortable).

Link to the survey: https://goo.gl/forms/kTJ5D3NoNm7qnV7D3

A demonstration against sexual assault is being held somewhere. Any woman who have experienced it or just want to turn up to show their support is welcome. 

However, the founder of the demonstration  has said that republican women are not welcome because the republican party is racist, sexist and homophobic. 

Is this okay? Should only a certain category of women who have experienced assault be welcomed? I’m asking because this is happening in my country where women from a party similar to the republican party are not welcome to participate in the demonstration.

I don’t agree with some of the political views of these women but I also feel uneasy that some women aren’t welcome to participate just because they vote for lr belong to other political parties. I actually don’t care about party politics, sexual assault is far more greater and affects every woman no matter gender, race or political leaning.

The whole thing has thrown me and I am stuck because I am not sure how to deal with this at all. I have a fair idea of which women it may concern and of course I believe them, I am just struggling as I consider him a good friend. 

Part of me wants to challenge him, but feel this might be unfair to the unnamed parties who are understandably trying to find a way to deal with it- the whisper network exists for a reason.

I consider myself a socialist and a feminist but I'm not quite as well read as I'd like to be, so I chose to investigate these topics to build my language skills. If you're familiar with Spanish socialist or feminist writing, I'd appreciate some direction.

If you're familiar with both, I have a question. The socialist left has historically had the most progressive stance on women and queer movements. However, some of what I've read indicates that worker movements in Spanish speaking countries have considered feminism an enemy, and this primarily has to do with ""feminismo"" being considered a liberal movement. My impression was that this is a common connotation in the language. To what extent is this true?

Here are the sources that led me to this question.

Ackelsburg mentions that the women's movement of anarchist Catalonia didn't consider themselves feminists.

If you are sitting there wondering why the hell you would even attempt to find common ground with such toxic people, you may not have seen any of the several studies suggesting that people have extreme difficulty changing their views even in the light of clear opposing evidence. The only way around this issue, it seems, is to frame discussions in a way that lets your conversation partner know that you understand their beliefs/fears/complaints and you are on their side.

My wife and I found that the above method worked pretty well with a conspiracy theorist neighbor we had, but his crazy ideas now feel surprisingly tame compared to the dense web of negativity people like incels and MGTOW have gotten wrapped up in. It's much harder to find common ground with people who genuinely think half of the world population is basically trash.

That being said, there seems to be an obvious trend (with members of these groups) of past romance clouding judgement, or failed interactions with women that have traumatized them for life. Do you think the start of helping these guys let go of all the hate and fear could be to relate to their own traumas somehow?

Can women even be involved in the discussion or will anything they say, no matter how reasonable, be construed as feminine trickery? Do you see any other way of getting through to these men?

I hope this was all a coherent read. Also, I'll try to find some articles on the subject of evidence rejection and bias and link to them later.

I found them a few months ago and instantly loved their shows and how they interact with one another. Their podcasts helped me a lot in securing my newfound feminist beliefs, and I started to ask myself why I love their personalities so much. After thinking for a bit about what it is that makes them so enjoyable to listen to, I started to realize that it could be because they have all the positive traits of the male gender and few (if any) of the negative traits. To me, the McElroys have nailed what it means to be masculine without the toxic elements that come with it. They have a certain set of values and behaviors that play up the specific style of strength, positive attitude and dependibility that is often found in our culture's idea of a man, and play down the violence, condescending attitude and controllingness that makes up toxic masculinity. As a man myself, I strive to be more like the McElroys by looking at what my gender identity does to my behavior and how I can combat the toxic elements of it.

Am I neurotic? Personally, yeah, kinda. 

BUT. Even if there is published research where ""neurotic"" is explicitly defined and the sample size is large enough to demonstrate that ""women are on average more neurotic"" (and I doubt this dataset exists) -- it does not necessarily imply that said neuroticism is an unavoidable sex-linked trait. 

It seems like you could make an argument of equal quality that it's the result of social conditioning. 

If you take an ambitious woman and raise her in a society that conditions her to hold back and let men do everything, she will either have to constantly fight the urge to be ambitious or rationalize it by saying that nothing she does is any good anyway. Would that lead to more worrying, panicking, inability to handle stress and failure, and obsessiveness? And could these behaviors be interpreted as ""neurotic"" ? Seems possible. Why not, while we're painting with such broad strokes anyway?

This also makes me think of the episode of South Park where they try to figure out why the monkeys attack everyone and fail to connect their behavior to the fact that they are pissing on the monkeys. The monkeys start off normal, then get pissed on, and then react violently and the scientists say that the monkeys have gone crazy and shoot them.

**Argument #2:** Feminism is bad for men because if a woman accuses a man of rape his reputation will be ruined and she wont get adequately punishment for it.

When a woman successfully convinces her employer to allow her to work from home it’s made out like she’s a huge success and a smart business women etc. but the thing is, she’s still a stay at home mum, still doing “women’s work” only now she has paid work to do in between. She’ll not only do her women’s work but also her paid work while her partner just does paid work and a couple of chores. It’s still inequality. It isn’t an achievement towards being equal to men. 

What would be an achievement? Men staying at home full time, men working from home while doing “women’s work” and men taking leave. But these won’t happen until attitudes change so that they don’t feel like they’re less of a good worker/man (welcome to our world right?)  

And when Australia got their first woman Chief Justice of the High Court it was celebrated hugely. Of course it’s a big deal but seeing women at the top should be a default position, why are we clapping our hands at the tiniest of progress?

It makes the issue a matter of perspective ('well if only she were more understanding and not so damn sensitive about things! Why, she should take it as a compliment!')and not about an abuse of power (especially when bosses or blokes in authority approach employees).

I've seen more and more magazines and articles (like in Vox, the BBC, Slate, the NYT) use the phrase, and I think it needs to end. People who think this issue isn't serious will ignore and attack the evidence because of it's use.

tl;dr: Stop calling sexual harassment unwanted advances.

Edit: To be clear, I'm not saying that I have an issue with the term itself. If some bloke approaches you at the pub and you turn him down, that's an 'unwanted advance' but that doesn't mean its inappropriate or 'bad' or anything else. I'm saying that there has been a worrying uptick in the term's usage by reporters and by social scientists when they're really talking about or looking into issues of workplace harassment. One example has been a study (cited by a few different newspapers and magazines) about how a large percentage of women in the work place have experiences 'sexual harassment or unwanted advances'.

At 17 when she is molested by a stranger, she didn't stop him or tell him no she's told that it was ok and she probably enjoyed it. 

At 19 her virginity is raped from her after she had been drinking. Once again, paralyzed in fear she didn't tell him no or stop him. Her friends don't believe her when she said she didn't want it to happen. 

When she is in her twenties she finally tries to tell someone and they tell her she is dirty and unclean now. They never talk to her again.

If you're a male who has never sexually harassed, abused, or assaulted a woman, and you think you deserve some kind special credit or award or recognition or a pat on the back for never having done those things, this a reminder that sexually harassing / abusing / assaulting women is something YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO.

Look, I get it. You're a decent man. And the thought of you sharing the same gender as those other horrific men that have caused all the sexual harassment, abuse, &amp; assault that you've ever heard of, and even more that you haven't heard of, makes you physically ill. Maybe it even triggers you because you were attacked in some way in your past, unjustly lumped in with something bad and made to seem you were a part of it. And that sparks a rage in you that makes you want fight like fire-breathing dragon against the evil predatory men of this world. Your wanting to help in the fight is good, and greatly appreciated if done right.

BUT...

This is not about YOU. This is about WOMEN.

~~~ deviating from my main point for a moment ~~~

91% of the victims of rape and sexual assault are female, and 9% are male. You as a male may have been the victim of sexual harassment, abuse, or assault. I have seen some men posting ""me too"" and telling their stories of abuse. It is real and it is sad, and they deserve to be part of the discussion. But, 93.7% of male rape perpetrators are male, which means possibly as much as 99% of rape is caused by males, and again 91% of rape victims are female. Because of this (and the track record of humanity over the last 6,000 years) this issue is primarily seen as a woman's issue versus the men who have been victimizing them, so women are getting the lead roles and the spotlight on this issue, and that's the thing I'm talking about in this post. So I don't mean to dismiss any male abuse victims, I see you and I will fight for you too. I just have a specific point I'm trying to make here, and the way it's getting phrased might sound like I'm excluding you, so please know that I am not.

~~~ having said that, back to my main point ~~~

So, decent male person who has never committed any such atrocities, when last we left you, you were stewing in the simple genetic fact that you were born a man, just like all those other evil fucking men, bully men, groping men, raping men, and it sickens you and upsets you. The thought of you being associated in any way with those fucks, even by the pure coincidence of being the same gender, appalls you, possibly even triggers you. So you turn on your device to find out what's going on in the world, maybe even help because you want to be an ally. Good! Be informed! So what do you see...

You see thousands of women taking to the street in protest, reporting the crimes of abuse against them, putting it out in the media, letting the world know that they will no longer stand this abuse any longer, that this is the generation that's going to put a stop to it! Fuck yeah! This is great!

But in the mix, due to the fact that up to 99% of all sexual harassment / abuse / assault is committed by men, and 91% of the victims are women, your hear tens of thousands of women chanting, over and over again...

MEN ARE THE PROBLEM.
MEN ARE THE PROBLEM.
MEN ARE THE PROBLEM.
MEN ARE THE PROBLEM.

It's written on signs, it's in internet memes, it's in song lyrics, it is everywhere. The all encompassing message that men, males, Y-chomosome-having-motherfuckers are the cause of this problem, and they need to be dealt with, punished, arrested, prosecuted, and jailed for their sins/crimes.

And you gasp. *GASP!* And you say to yourself, 'but, but, but...*I'M* not one of *THOSE* men! That's not me! No!' And you get upset. You pace and you bite your fingernails and gnash your teeth and mutter to yourself 'No, no, no, no, no, no, no, NO! I've never committed any such atrocities! I can't be lumped in with all of those repeat-abusers and serial rapists! I just can't!!!' And I get that. I empathize. I don't want to be associated with those assholes either. But it's what some of you are doing next where the big problem lies...

So you, a decent human male and well intentioned ally, jump into the fray, showing up at a rally, joining in an online discussion, helping a political campaign of someone trying to make changes for the better to fight all this. Things are going fine. But then some women in their talking about this issue puts forth the oft chanted notion that MEN ARE THE PROBLEM. And that's when you, disgusted at the notion that you could be considered part of the male population that is 'the problem', raise your hand and say...

'Um, actually, not ALL men are the problem, just so you know. I mean, I'm a man, and I'm not one of those bad men. So, just, you know, wanted to clarify. Okay? We cool? Thanks!...'

... I'm not even going to continue this little hypothetical fable because you can fill in the blank on what happens next. The point remains the same, THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU. IT'S ABOUT THEM, THE WOMEN.

You may be saying, 'But that isn't fair!'

TOO BAD. LIFE ISN'T FAIR.

- Here's your problem: -
You as a male being seemingly being lumped in with all the horrible men due to the generalities of the rhetoric of a protest movement.

- Here's women's problem: -
GETTING RAPED AND MURDERED AND FONDLED AND GROPED AND OGLED AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND EARNING LESS MONEY AND BEING MADE TO FEEL LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT INSTEAD OF A PERSON AND OH DID I MENTION THE GETTING RAPED AND MURDERED AND MAYBE RAPED AGAIN PART?

So, it's your fee-feez vs. rape &amp; death.

YOUR. PROBLEM. AIN'T. SHIT.
Sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up.

You have this thing that women don't have, it's called 'privilege'. I have a whole bunch of privilege. I'm a male, white, straight, cis, Christian-raised, Middle-Class-raised blonde with blue eyes. If I had 20 million dollars and Channing Tatum's body, I'd have every space filled on the privilege bingo card. And when you have privilege AND you're a decent human being, there are certain things you can't do.

You can't use the N-word. Black people can if they want.

You can't use word f-g. Homosexual people can if they want.

So because you have been granted 'privilege' due to being born a male, one of the things you really should NOT be doing, is interrupting conversations where women are trying to fight against male oppression, just so you can point out that you as a male are not oppressing them.

DON'T. Just don't.

That's the trade off. You get the 'privilege', women get to make the blanket statement that 'Men are the problem' in their fight against men's abuse and oppression.

'But I never asked for this 'privilege'!'

TOO FUCKING BAD. You have it whether you want it or not. Women were born not wanting to get raped, but they have to deal with that. You're getting off more than light with your dainty-ass 'privilege'.

So if you want to be a decent human male person, you need to have self-awareness of your privilege in your words and actions, and not do anything to deflate, sideline, or in any way diminish the message women are trying to get out there in their struggle.

Don't say ""Not all men"". Saying nothing at all is far far more helpful than saying ""Not all men"". That might bother you or hurt your feelings. Deal with it, suck it up, and zip it if you really care about helping the cause. Better yet, instead say ""What can I do?"" I asked that yesterday, and many women gave me a lot of great advice and insight on what I can do to be an ally to women, both individually and for the whole cause.

I know I've been rough on you, decent male person. I used a bunch of swears and said some mean sounding shit. If I hurt your feelings, I am genuinely sorry, but I typed this whole thing up because I care about you, and because YOU ARE A DECENT HUMAN MALE, and the cause needs every decent person it can get. I just needed to spell it all out for you so you can understand, really understand, why saying ""Not all men"" only hurts the cause and, frankly, makes you look like a fucking douchebag. Are you a douchebag? No, you're not. You're a decent human male. Make that a decent human being. So please, help humanity by doing what we need to do to help women by keeping the focus on them in this fight. Be mindful, and be decent.

Finally, if you have your own issues, things from your present or your past that cause you pain to this day, reach out for help. Your personal struggle is important too, and we are all in this together. There are friends, family, professionals, even strangers at meetings you can talk to. You are strong and can defeat whatever demons are plaguing you. People care about you, and want to help you too. You just have to ask.",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,A man 'splains to other men an important key to being an ally to women,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/79e1sq/a_man_splains_to_other_men_an_important_key_to/

I've been reading and watching a lot of videos about feminism recently and I stumbled across this particular TEDTalk about violence against women, men speaking up, and the bystander approach: https://www.ted.com/talks/jackson_katz_violence_against_women_it_s_a_men_s_issue#t-717977
I posted it on /r/AskFeminists and was told it might be appreciated here.
I was wondering what everyone's thoughts are about this video and if you have any feedback on the way Jackson presents his views.

I particularly am torn about the last portion on the video where he talks about the world needing more ""men with power"" and resources to speak up for women. While I agree with this, I also think that the way he presents it (men with power, courage, worthy of praise for speaking up) might be in a way counter-productive for feminism. If a man is going to feel praised and almost heroic for raising his voice about women's rights and equality or if he does it just because it means he is courageous and strong and influential, I don't think it goes well with Feminism.

I hope I made myself at least a bit clear.

I do agree with most other points he talks about throughout the video and would love to hear any feedback on all topics discussed, but that one in particular bothers me a bit.

As a black woman in the dating world I feel like I'm at the bottom of the chain, especially when it comes to racial preferences and fetishes. I've been hinted at and told by many men that they prefer white women over me and its just soul crushing. I usually date Asian guys and I wouldn't feel a thing if they prefered Asian women but when it comes to white women it reminds me of the times that I wanted to bleach my skin and look white. Some Asian guys would only date me because they've never had sex with a black woman before. The more I think about my preference the more I think how stupid and unnecessary it is. I notice that alot of black men are like this too, they prefer white women over their own race, it doesn't just end at preferences(which I think it's fine) it goes further to making anti black women videos on YouTube and berating black women. I remember in class this black guy said that black women are disgusting. Preferences are not just harmful to colored women but it's harmful to white women as well. In Asia there's a term called ""riding the white horse"" which is basically saying that you should have sex with a white girl because she's white and that you should date and marry her go show her off to your friends. Of course there are people who find white women attractive for their appearance, I think white women are beautiful as well but it seems like the majority of people who prefer white people over their own race have this certain mentality like they were raised to believe that white people are better than other races including their own. Some racial preferences are fine but I think the majority would only be fine if the world's history was different. If there were no colonized areas or the mentality that lighter is better than dark. I'm still battling wanting to bleach my skin and get plastic surgery, do you think that preferences are harmful to women?

As a little girl, I was not just encouraged, but legally obligated to get educated. The cartoons I watched actually contained strong, smart female characters. Although they wouldn't often be the heroes of the story, I'd see characters like Francine from Arthur, or velma from Scooby Doo and I would have someone to relate to and look up to, whose entire life didn't revolve around pleasing their husband. And what was the key for me, they were smart. It helped me build up confidence as a kid, as even though I'd learn about Marie Curie or other amazing women in history, the characters in the cartoons felt relatable. 

I wasn't trapped in a marriage at an early age, due to it being my only option. I had other options at life than marrying someone that would provide for me. I didn't have to worry about locking someone down before my young looks expired. I was able to live on my own. 

I was able to go to college. I can't say I learned as much as I would have wanted to, due to struggling with personal issues at that time, but still. I was allowed to go to college. Even more, it wasn't a ridiculous thing for me to do. It actually allowed me to have a good job, because companies are not allowed to discriminate based on gender any longer.

At my current job, I was able to move up, because my opinion and insight was taken seriously. I wasnt just there to look pretty, but to actually add value as a human being. I'm now able to make money doing what I enjoy, even though what I do may not be considered feminine. 

A lot of the above things would not have been possible without the feminist movement, and although there's still struggles with misogyny I just wanted to make a post appreciating everything that's been accomplished in the past few decades. So thank you to all you people that have dedicated your lives to allowing women like me to live independent and fulfilling lives.

Specifically this bit :
""Significantly fewer people would consider dating, either casually or seriously, a trans man, woman or non-binary individual – 17%, 16% and 18% respectively. Respondents were even less likely to be open to the idea of engaging in a sexual act of any kind with a trans man or non-binary person (15%), and even fewer would consider intimacy with a transgender woman (13%). In the past twelve months, only 4% of Americans have been on a date with a transgender person.""

If these stats are anywhere near accurate around 85% of the population would not sleep with a trans person if they knew that person was trans.

What effect does this info have on issues surrounding trans people divulging their status with sexual partners and informed consent?

After he did prayers from his seat, we talked a bit about Islamic law.

He told me earnestly that [the Koran equates the testimony of two women with that of one man] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_women%27s_testimony_in_Islam). Despite this, apparently, it was possible for a woman to be a judge, even a judge on the country's highest court.  But if that theoretical lady judge ever became a witness in court, her testimony was - of course! - a clean 50% of any man's testimony.

These odd juxtapositions didn't seem to phase the guy, but I remember thinking that, as a guy, I was glad to live in a country (USA) that didn't have such a *codified* metric to dehumanize women.

I didn't think much about this conversation for over 25 years.

Then I saw articles about Weinstein.  And Toback.  And Ratner.  And Louis CK (and more).  And it hit me - wouldn't it be great if it only took *two* women to equal the dismissive denials of one powerful man?

I'm not trying to make broad comparisons about religion, or nationality.  These are obviously complex issues.

It just makes me sad that in a country that loves to lecture the world about human rights and democracy, the going rate for women to be believed about something so painful and personal seems to be hovering at somewhere between 5:1 and 10:1.

I know that we are at a moment where things might change, but I am frankly not too optimistic.  It's great that highly privileged women are finally able to risk speaking out.  Ellen Page's post today was amazing.  But I read the comments on reddit about how Amber Heard is a gold digger, how Selma Blair should have spoken out about Toback years ago (as if she had anything to gain by speaking now).  As a family law attorney, representing roughly equal numbers of women and men, I hear about how tough it is for men in family courts (untrue, to my mind), even from my clients.

I’m not here to cut it down point-by-point. I think it’s generally a good piece that makes some good points.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/opinion/anger-women-weinstein-assault.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Flindy-west&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection

I’m kinda baffled by this paragraph, though:

""*Just this week, Juli Briskman, a government contractor, lost her job after a photo of her flipping off the presidential motorcade went viral. Solange, Britney Spears, Sinead O’Connor, the Dixie Chicks, Rosie O’Donnell — I struggle to think of women who lost their tempers in public and didn’t face ridicule, temporary ruin, or both. And we don’t even have to be angry to be called angry. Accusations of being an “angry black woman” chased Michelle Obama throughout her tenure at the White House, despite eight years of unflappable poise (black women suffer disproportionately under this paradigm). The decades-long smearing of Hillary Clinton as an unhinged shrew culminated one year ago today when, despite maintaining a preternatural calm throughout the most brutal campaign in living memory, she lost the election to masculinity’s apoplectic id.
*""
Her examples are interesting:
-	Briskman worked for a government contractor, and flipped off the President. I would expect to be fired for flipping off the CEO of any of our clients, much less our only client. It wouldn’t even be a question. 

-	Solange violently assaulted a man in an elevator because she was mad that he cheated on her sister. She wasn’t arrested. She faced no physical retaliation. She didn’t lose her career. The public’s reaction at the time was essentially, “You go, girl!”  She faced no repercussions, and if she had, she’d have deserved them. We’re trying to teach people NOT to assault others based on who they have sex with, right? West actually categorizes her simply as a “Wom[a]n who lost [her] temper.” Yeah, she lost her temper like Ray Rice did. How are we to believe society has treated her unfairly here?

-	Spears went after a cameraman with an umbrella, apparently because she was pissed off after leaving Kevin Federline’s house. Should we not expect some backlash here? Don’t we also love to tear down male celebrities who suffer mental health issues in public?

-	Sinead O’Connor insulted an entire religion. She did so in order to cause controversy. The negative backlash was predictable. Do we really believe that she was treated poorly because she was a woman?

-	The Dixie Chicks, whose fan base is primarily red state dickheads, went to another country and publicly bashed a dickhead President beloved by red state dickheads. What did they expect would happen? Would a male artist with the same fan base skate by after doing that?

-	Rosie O’Donnell publicly suggested that a 10 year old child was autistic. She is not in any way qualified to assess this, and although Barron is very likely a future dickhead (the poop doesn’t fall far from the butthole, as they say), he’s a 10 year old kid who doesn’t yet deserve scrutiny from O’Donnell’s bully pulpit.  She’s free to speak her mind, but it was her mouth, not her vagina, that earned her scrutiny.

-	Hillary lost some votes because she is a woman. She gained some votes because she is a woman. She lost the election because she was uniquely qualified to lose to Rump, and was forced on voters by her dysfunctional party. The Democrats will continue to blame sexism at their peril. 
 

I think there are enough real problems that women face in this world (West actually does a pretty good job pointing these out in the rest of the piece) that piling on bullshit ones is a distraction.

**""Sisterhood is still powerful""**

When the slogan “Sisterhood is powerful” was first used, it was awesome. I began my full-fledged participation in feminist movement my sophomore year in college. Attending an all women’s college for a year before I transferred to Stanford University, I knew from firsthand experience the difference in female self-esteem and self-assertion in same-sex classrooms versus those where males were present. At Stanford males ruled the day in every classroom. Females spoke less, took less initiative, and often when they spoke you could hardly hear what they were saying. Their voices lacked strength and confidence. And to make matters worse we were told time and time again by male professors that we were not as intelligent as the males, that we could not be “great” thinkers, writers, and so on. These attitudes shocked me since I had come from an all-female environment where our intellectual worth and value was constantly affirmed by the standard of academic excellence our mostly female professors set for us and themselves.



Indeed, I was indebted to my favorite white female English professor who thought I was not getting the academic guidance I needed at our women’s college because they did not have an intensified writing program. She encouraged me to attend Stanford. She believed that I would someday be an important thinker and writer.



At Stanford my ability was constantly questioned. I began to doubt myself. Then feminist movement rocked the campus. Female students and professors demanded an end to discrimination based on gender inside and outside the classroom. Wow, it was an intense and awesome time. There I took my first women’s studies class with the writer Tillie Olsen, who compelled her students to think first and foremost about the fate of women from working-class backgrounds. There the scholar and one-day biographer of Anne Sexton, Diane Middlebrook, passed out one of my poems in our class on contemporary poetry with no name on it and asked us to identify whether the writer was male or female, an experiment that made us think critically about judging the value of writing on the basis of gender biases. There I began to write my first book at the age of 19, Ain’t I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism. None of these incredible transformations would have happened without feminist movement creating a foundation for solidarity between women.



That foundation rested on our critique of what we then called “the enemy within,” referring to our internalized sexism. We all knew firsthand that we had been socialized as females by patriarchal thinking to see ourselves as inferior to men, to see ourselves as always and only in competition with one another for patriarchal approval, to look upon each other with jealousy, fear, and hatred. Sexist thinking made us judge each other without compassion and punish one another harshly. Feminist thinking helped us unlearn female self-hatred. It enabled us to break free of the hold patriarchal thinking had on our consciousness.



Male bonding was an accepted and affirmed aspect of patriarchal culture. It was simply assumed that men in groups would stick together, support one another, be team players, place the good of the group over individual gain and recognition. Female bonding was not possible within patriarchy; it was an act of treason. Feminist movement created the context for female bonding. We did not bond against men, we bonded to protect our interests as women. When we challenged professors who taught no books by women, it was not because we did not like those professors (we often did); rightly, we wanted an end to gender biases in the classroom and in the curriculum.



The feminist transformations that were taking place in our coed college in the early ‘70s were taking place as well in the world of home and work. First and foremost feminist movement urged females to no longer see ourselves and our bodies as the property of men. To demand control of our sexuality, effective birth control and reproductive rights, an end to rape and sexual harassment, we needed to stand in solidarity. In order for women to change job discrimination we needed to lobby as a group to change public policy. Challenging and changing female sexist thinking was the first step towards creating the powerful sisterhood that would ultimately rock our nation.



Following in the wake of civil rights revolution feminist movement in the ‘70s and ‘80s changed the face of our nation. The feminist activists who made these changes possible cared for the well-being of all females. We understood that political solidarity between females expressed in sisterhood goes beyond positive recognition of the experiences of women and even shared sympathy for common suffering. Feminist sisterhood is rooted in shared commitment to struggle against patriarchal injustice, no matter the form that injustice takes. Political solidarity between women always undermines sexism and sets the stage for the overthrow of patriarchy. Significantly, sisterhood could never have been possible across the boundaries of race and class if individual women had not been willing to divest of their power to dominate and exploit subordinated groups of women. As long as women are using class or race power to dominate other women, feminist sisterhood cannot be fully realized.



As more women begin to opportunistically lay claim to feminism in the ‘80s without undergoing the feminist consciousness-raising that would have enabled them to divest of their sexism, the patriarchal assumption that the powerful should rule over the weak informed their relations to other women. As women, particularly previously disenfranchised privileged white women, began to acquire class power without divesting of their internalized sexism, divisions between women intensified. When women of color critiqued the racism within the society as a whole and called attention to the ways that racism had shaped and informed feminist theory and practice, many white women simply turned their backs on the vision of sisterhood, closing their minds and their hearts. And that was equally true when it came to the issue of classism among women.I remember when feminist women, mostly white women with class privilege, debated the issue of whether or not to hire domestic help, trying to come up with a way to not participate in the subordination and dehumanization of less-privileged women. Some of those women successfully created positive bonding between themselves and the women they hired so that there could be mutual advancement in a larger context of inequality. Rather than abandoning the vision of sisterhood, because they could not attain some utopian state, they created a real sisterhood, one that took into account the needs of everyone involved. This was the hard work of feminist solidarity between women. Sadly, as opportunism within feminism intensified, as feminist gains became commonplace and were therefore taken for granted, many women did not want to work hard to create and sustain solidarity.



A large body of women simply abandoned the notion of sisterhood. Individual women who had once critiqued and challenged patriarchy re-aligned themselves with sexist men. Radical women who felt betrayed by the fierce negative competition between women often simply retreated. And at this point feminist movement, which was aimed at positively transforming the lives of all females, became more stratified. The vision of sisterhood that had been the rallying cry of the movement seemed to many women to no longer matter. Political solidarity between women which had been the force putting in place positive change has been and is now consistently undermined and threatened. As a consequence we are as in need of a renewed commitment to political solidarity between women as we were when contemporary feminist movement first began.



When contemporary feminist movement first began we had a vision of sisterhood with no concrete understanding of the actual work we would need to do to make political solidarity a reality. Through experience and hard work, and, yes, by learning from our failures and mistakes, we now have in place a body of theory and shared practice that can teach new converts to feminist politics what must be done to create, sustain, and protect our solidarity. Since masses of young females know little about feminism and many falsely assume that sexism is no longer the problem, feminist education for critical consciousness must be continuous. Older feminist thinkers cannot assume that young females will just acquire knowledge of feminism along the way to adulthood. They require guidance. Overall women in our society are forgetting the value and power of sisterhood. Renewed feminist movement must once again raise the banner high to proclaim anew “Sisterhood is powerful.”



Radical groups of women continue our commitment to building sisterhood, to making feminist political solidarity between women an ongoing reality. We continue the work of bonding across race and class. We continue to put in place the anti-sexist thinking and practice which affirms the reality that females can achieve self-actualization and success without dominating one another. And we have the good fortune to know everyday of our lives that sisterhood is concretely possible, that sisterhood is still powerful.

I see many things wrong with the world, both globally and in my community, that I would like to change and make better, and I have the fortune of living in a social environment where the majority of people I interact with are within the same mindset. The vast majority of my friends identify as feminists, and those who for some reason don't usually still have mostly feminist values. My boyfriend is wonderful and while he maybe doesn't always understand the issues and isn't always of the same opinion our values match up really well. 

However, when I sort of venture outside my normal social circle I so often seem to come across hatefulness and ridicule. People reducing feminism to bitter, ugly and fat women who are angry that they aren't getting attention. People saying that modern feminism has no validity because they don't agree that things are problematic. You know the whole ""this isn't a problem and claiming that it is is completely unreasonable because I don't see it as such and my behaviour isn't problematic and you are just crazy attention whores."" And being called the equivalent of a liberal whore because I see it as our duty as a rich and free country to help for example those escaping from war.

And sometimes I feel it's all so exhausting. It's like a constant uphill battle, fighting to fix things that many don't even view as problems. And sometimes the opposition comes from such unexpected places, like when I complained to my mom about men groping me at a club, and she sort of laughed and said that they should be allowed to touch me a little. She even seemed a bit disapproving about my attitude that no one has a right to intentionally touch me in a sexual way without my permission. As if I had been too aggressive when I had shoved away men who came from behind and rubbed their crotches on my ass. As if I should be careful not to scare away men because who would want a woman who pushes back? As if *I* would want a man who harasses me?

Sometimes it all just seems so hopeless, and it feels meaningless to try when it seems like the rest of the world just wants to ridicule and demean you. But it's not like I can stop holding these values and stop seeing the problematic things in our world. And facing so much resistance when trying to fix these problems is so fucking annoying and exhausting and troubling.

How do you others deal with this?

In re: Roy Moore and all sexual assault allegations. The most common refrain you see from people defending abusers is ""what happened to innocent until proven guilty"". I feel my place as a male feminist is to convince other men to take women at their word and to believe women when they relay their experiences, as opposed to constantly questioning or undermining them.

I, however, believe in the idea of 'innocent until proven guilty', so I feel like these two ideas are at odds with each other.

I don't doubt the allegations against Roy Moore, Harvey Weinstein, or Donald Trump. But how do I reconcile ""taking women at their word"" with the fact that they are just allegations?

To phrase it the way I see it phrased in defense of these men, what about innocent until proven guilty?

If someone could help me square this circle, so to speak, I feel like I would be better able to communicate it to other men who I know have the same question.

I've got this friend who isn't sold on Feminism, and I think she may have a somewhat limited or inaccurate view of what Feminism is.

Unfortunately my theory Kung Fu is not strong, but that sounds like a somewhat inaccurate reduction of what modern Feminism is. 

Do y'all have any reading on topics of workplace sexual or sexualized harassment where a woman is harassing another woman from a feminist perspective?

As most of Reddit, this sub is very US centric, so I guess that is why. So, I figured I'd post about it, as the impact here can be seen in the highest levels of society. 

There have been multiple happenings here, and it's hard to sum it all up succinctly. Perhaps others have links in English? The Local has written a little bit about it, but it's nothing in comparison to how this has dominated the major news sites in the last few weeks. The Local's articles can be found here: https://www.thelocal.se/tag/metoo

The site www.svd.se - Svenska Dagbladet - have been the most active in reporting on these issues, so that's available if you want to Google Translate. 

First up was many women coming together and accusing several prominent Swedish media men of harassment, multiple accounts of rape, as well as exposing a deeply sexist culture in many media houses. Then came actors - 456 of them (tiny country, all, yes all, popular Swedish actresses are in the petition and are outspoken) - that discussed the same issues in theatre and film. Opera singers and other classic musicians created a similar petition and also shared stories. Again, every popular name in that scene is in the petition. 

The Swedish minister of culture, Alice Bah Kuhnke, immediately called in all the managers of Sweden's national scenes (basically classic theatres etc) and demanded action and change following the reports from actors of how many very popular male actors are basically free to do whatever they want and get their ego stroked regardless of what heinous acts they have committed. The minister of equality, the minister of justice and Sweden's prime minister has also stepped out and demanded culture change.

The real shocker came today, as about 4400 female law professionals started a petition and shared stories. There were so many they had to stop taking submissions after less than 24 hours. The stories tell of situations where sexism has trumped justice (!) as well as, again, men being able to get away with harassment, continued sexist comments as well as rape. The men that are said to have committed these acts are judges, lawyers and attorneys. 

I feel invigorated, but please don't take that the wrong way - this is all awful stuff. As a man I have of course been safe from anything regarding this personally, but it's always been a struggle for me to deal with and call out the frankly immense amount of sexism Swedish men throw around when there are no women in the room, or even when they are in the room. Especially when we are always viewed as so equal by other nations. That may be true statistically, but many Swedish men - especially those 35 or over - are just as bad as in any country. I know the issue is structural, but I've always had a much easier time getting my similar aged peers to understand sexism is not okay. It's basically impossible with middle aged men. I gave up on trying to change my dad, which pains me. I hope this discussion makes men a bit more open to at least see their part in this and how everyday sexism is playing directly into establishing what is and what is not ok.

That so many stories are now being shared and the discourse is changing is fantastic. I just hope this momentum carries on further and that this shit stops being tolerated, as well as all these fucking men that have done this are either brought to justice or at least stop behaving in this completely unacceptable way. Mandatory education on harassment and consent in schools would also be a great step forward, and I hope we get there soon.

I have a good friend who, although a lovely person, doesn't really have great people skills. I noticed that when I would talk to her on feminism, I found either her views to be quite different to mine but also more importantly, that she would express things in a way that made me feel uncomfortable or alienated (even if I agreed). I also noticed, however, that her views were more consonant with mainstream feminism than mine were. While I respect her, it started to make me wonder if feminism is affected by the kind of women in it. That is, by  the fact that women who are atypical by society's standards, such as for example, those who are more rational than possessing people skills, are more likely to be drawn to it. I wonder if this affects feminist media, because I really feel like feminism has a tone problem when reaching the general public. Feminism isn't only relevant to certain kinds of women, but many feminists who are different from what has become the norm find it difficult to express their views. I've noticed since then that when I have spoken up, my views are often appreciated, maybe because I am 'different' than the kind of voices that have become raised in the movement.

I just had a curious thought when walking through Sephora the other day and noticing more and more male employees working there. I then looked on the walls at all of the pictures of female (presenting) models and wondered to myself how cool it would be if there were more representation of male models in makeup, and then I started questioning the whole thing.

Is the desire for more male represention in a space dominated by females a bad thing? I'm asking from a completely sympathetic perspective. As a gay male I feel as though wanting that male representation is possibly trying to push a male dominance into a space that women feel like is theirs, and since there are so few places like that it seems insensitive. 

Is asking for more representation in a space like this pushing women out or is it making it more inclusive to everyone? I hope what I'm asking isn't confusing I'm having trouble putting it into words.

First off, how drunk is too drunk when it comes to sex and consent?

Between those two extremes every person handles alcohol differently, so how do you decipher that moral grey area? Beyond that, what if both parties are intoxicated beyond the realm of reasonable consent? Are they both rape victims? Are they both rapists? Is it purely case by case?

Some people have decided to stop watching the show. With the casting of the new Doctor, Jodie Whittaker, have your opinions about the show changed? Steven Moffat will be leaving his role as showrunner, to be replaced by Chris Chibnall, creator and producer of the critically acclaimed *Broadchurch,* who has also written a few Doctor Who episodes, including *42, The Hungry Earth, Cold Blood, Dinsaurs on a Spaceship,* and *the Power of Three.*  He stated that he always wanted the 13th Doctor to be a woman, and is responsible for casting Whittaker as the Doctor. She is the first woman to take on the role of the Doctor since the show began 54 years ago.

I think that Chibnall will be a fantastic writer for the show, specifically in his treatment of characters. His writing for *Dinosaurs on a Spaceship* and *The Power of Three* stands out in how the female characters are written. Amy was for many the epitome of Moffat's sexism, yet in these two episodes, she's strong willed, independent, rounded, and really, really well written. This makes me really optimistic for his run on the show. It helps that Whittaker is a self-proclaimed feminist, too. Because of this, I think that Chibnall and Whittaker will be able to craft a strong female lead that may become a feminist icon for future generations. 

So, has the casting of Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor changed your point of view on the series? If you stopped watching, do you plan to check the show out again? and if you haven't watched Doctor Who before, has this piqued your interest?

It started in 1972 and had 10 years to be ratified by all 50 states.  It failed in 1982 because not all of the states had ratified it.  I remember her disappointment, her sadness.  By not passing it, the United States of America sent a clear message.  ""You are not equal, you are not valuable.""

But, you say, there's a law - we don't need an amendment.  A law could be repealed, an amendment is more meaningful, in a way that passing a law never can be.  An amendment means that every state agrees that women *are* equal.  That we are not less than men, that we are not less than anyone, simply because we have a vagina.  That our equality is important enough to add to the constitution.

We've started something with the #metoo movement that we're all, sadly, a part of.  Let's capitalize on it to REALLY get something done!  Reach out to your law makers and tell them that enough is enough, we need to say it with law - we are equal - we expect to be treated as such - and it's time for the E.R.A.!!

I’m not sure if I’m posting this in the right community because I’m not familiar with Reddit yet, but I was just seeking some advice on how to approach my current situation.

My younger brothers- ages 12 and 16, suddenly brought up a guy name Milo Yiannopoulous and his beliefs, one of them supposedly being “feminism is cancer” (?). My brothers were telling me how they actually believe this guy’s words and started talking about how feminism is mostly just starting to become hatred for men. They also started going off about how the wage gap doesn’t exist..

I sat there in disbelief that my younger brothers were actually saying this to my face, and I felt I had failed as an older sister. What exactly have they been watching on Youtube all this time? I fought back with them to defend feminism and get them to understand that feminism is purely about EQUALITY, but they were acting like I didn’t know what I was talking about.

Again, I’m not sure if I’m posting this in the right community, but how should I go in educating my brothers? I want to lead them in the right path. 

Also, I’m sorry if my thoughts and this post is kind of messy. ",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,Giving advice to younger brothers who believe in the words of Milo Yiannopoulos,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/7gkknh/giving_advice_to_younger_brothers_who_believe_in/

Thus, anything that is societally viewed as a career or task that is historically dominated by women (ex. nurse or stay at home parent) is viewed as “emasculating” if done by a man. 

However, that’s where the problem arises. Masculinity is socially constructed, thus the dichotomous consequence it creates through societal gender roles dictating what is viewed as masculine/emasculating or feminine should not influence what a person chooses to do. Going against the status quo, such as a man becoming a nurse or stay at home parent, should not be an indication that a male, for example,  is less of a man than a man who works in construction or sports.

Let’s put it this way:

Growing up, I viewed sports, labour that required physical strength, and being the breadwinner of the family, as masculine, and that anything opposite is emasculating (examples: wife makes more money than you, being a stay at home dad, etc.)

However, after going to college and learning that masculinity is a social construct, I realized I shouldn’t let the status quo influence my decision regarding my career path because of what society views as emasculating. Thus, I left a male dominated field to enter a female dominated field despite being a man. I learned that entering a career dominated by females does not make a male less of a man than a male who plays in the NBA.

I've also heard him make jokes about the wage gap, comment on how feminists don't call out bad women, etc. 

I'm feeling very depressed about the whole thing, as its coming at a point in our relationship where I love him but this makes me want to be alone. 

UPDATE: I wrote this post when I was very hurt and frustrated, hence the lack of detail. Since then, I took some advice from the answers and confronted my bf when I had a chance to cool down and sort through why I was hurt. We ended up talking for a long time, shared our experiences and found out where we really disagreed on certain topics. He has many queer feminist friends, and that gave me a way to talk to him about the subject. While he wouldn't describe himself as a feminist, I was able to say why discrediting the movement hurt me and was dangerous. On the other hand, he got a chance to discuss his issues with it, (extremist attitudes) and we agreed that its a flawed movement, like any other movement, but has aspects to it that need to be better explained and embraced. 

I'm really grateful to have someone that I can work through disagreements with. Contrary to what some may have believed, we're not teenagers, we're in our late 20s and have both agreed on multiple occasions we're in this for the long haul (which he has proven time and time again). My goal with this post was never to hear ppl say ""dump him"" but rather tips on how to sort through my own feelings and talk to him about it. I spent some time alone after hearing the conversation and he was great enough to give me the space until I was ready to talk.

I want to tell a quick story about how I changed perspectives on the issues that women face on the day to day grind.

'The Sex Actually Podcast ' is equal parts stories of sexual experiences, both successes and failures, and also cautionary tales of where past relationships have gone wrong. We talk about what drives us, improving communication in our dating lives, and how our family upbringing molded us into who we are today. One thing I've learned spending countless hours chatting with Tasha, my live-in partner and cohost, is that women don't always have the luxury of sharing stories of the freedom of a drunken night gallivanting around town. Too often the story ends with a man fucking up a woman's trust and freedom to be present.

I guess this post is a 'feminist teacher appreciation post', which I look forward to doing more often. Instead of shaming me for not walking a mile in her shoes, or shunning me for not being able to relate, Tasha takes the time to explain to me her day to day experiences. I've learned to listen. Just last week, an innocent trip to the grocery store ended with her being followed around several aisles because a man decided it was the appropriate market to be hitting on women. He didn't accept her social cues and commented on her boobs by telling her 'looks like your girls are out to play'. Ya dude, Frozen Food aisle is the new tinder. And the thing about men is, he would have never made her feel uncomfortable if I was shopping with her. We respect women in the presence of other men, but then when alone, cowards like frozen food guy emerge with their witty pickup lines.

Tasha will never know the freedom that I have to get drunk with friends, stumble home on the subway, interview for a job solely based on merit, and so many other countless basic rights. I am a comedian, it is a privilege to speak my opinions. Tasha works as a model. She's a brilliant thinker, very well read and a major advocate for the feminist movement. Yet, she is encouraged to not show emotions, never mind take a stance on social issues. Some men want to look at models, not hear them think. It makes the models human, and that ruins their experience. Can't keep that boner hard if these models keep yapping about ways to improve humanity. Yuck.

This past election season Tasha posted an instagram pic in support of Bernie Sanders. She was nervous to share her opinion, as most of her photos are lifestyle images, showing off a carefree and opinion less side of her. Most of Tasha's following was supportive, but it only takes one asshole to highlight the issues women face. “You're not pretty enough to offer thoughts on politics. UNFOLLOW”. Quick research showed us that this comment was written by a dude who is a college football coach and father to a teenage girl. THIS opened my eyes to the shame and control of thoughts that men put on women. Now clearly this man has issues, but he said what a lot of men think. 'Not now honey, the men are talking...'. A quick attempt at doing something meaningful that doesn't exactly fit into the confines of her job description was swatted down effortlessly by a stranger online. I was there to comfort her, but the helpless feeling of not being able to confront this dude face to face helped me realize that women feel that feeling everyday. Not being able to fight a fare fight. Unfortunately it took the ignorance of another man to show me which side I want to be on. Tasha and I bonded that day.

What I love about our show and our relationship in general, is that we challenge each other's point of view. We are fortunate enough to be having a dialogue together that I've never had with women before. We don't always agree on every issue, but I hope other couples are having similar discussions. Understanding each other will help us resolve the issues that come from a lack of empathy. Respect isn't something owned only to our mothers, sisters and wives, but also to the stranger at the grocery store, or woman walking alone on the street. Men, we aren't losing our seat at the table, we're just finally letting women enjoy the meal with us. Lets listen.

	I am writing today to discuss epistemology and feminist objectivity. “Feminist objectivity means quite simple situated knowledge.” Sandra Harding discusses the validity of “situated knowledge” and why it is not an opinion, as conventionalist accounts argue. Socially situated knowledge is defined as an “apparent contradiction in terms.” Harding’s goal is to convey how feminist thought and reflections challenge the norms and values of conventional science. She argues these norms and values are not maximally objective because they are created by a dominant group for managing and understanding the marginalized. Rather, Harding and standpoint theorists believe that we should start scientific research from the marginalized lifestyle. When further explained, the marginalized person can produce knowledge different from and complicating for their dominant counterpart. These feminist thinkers argue the dominant group finds questions, procedures, and solutions that all conform to their agenda. Standpoint epistemology works to solve the supposed objectivity in conventional scientific research, which is often understood as the production of knowledge. 
	Knowledge is, as Harding says, often created by an individual or small group but is not collectively recognized till validated by the community. Feminist Standpoint theorists establish new “grounds” for knowledge. Placing the woman’s perspective, or from other marginalized communities, at the center of epistemological projects will produce an incomplete, but more maximally objective, object of knowledge. Furthermore, a woman’s perspective will produce different scientific questions which can direct knowledge discoveries down an alternative path from those produced by conventional methods.
	Standpoint theory does not attempt to act as the “God-trick”, because standpoint theory does not originate from universal human problems, nor is standpoint theory ethnocentric (Harding pp. 46). Feminist standpoint theory finds objectivity in each marginalized person’s account criticizing the gender-based loyalties of either masculine or feminine researchers. Therefore standpoint feminism encourages empirical research from the marginalized person’s perspective. This will question and critique conventional methods of research in addition to providing a potentially better analysis of a given situation. Harding says all social situations are good for starting knowledge research, but some social situations may be more effective for certain thought projects. 
	Harding challenges the subjects of objectivity arguing conventional objectivity is not maximally objective because it does not acknowledge its implicit assumptions–about values and beliefs–and these subjects retain their socio-historical motivations for such thought projects which are evident in their results. A scientist will find certain conclusions in accordance to his hypothesis while rejecting other solutions when they do not align nicely. This complicates further experimentation as future knowledge projects will build on previous discoveries. “All of the kinds of objectivity-maximizing procedures focused on the nature and/or social relations that are the direct object of observation and reflection must also be focused on the observers and reflectors (Harding pp. 55).” 
	
Critiques and Objections:
	Feminist standpoint theory redefines the meaning of objectivity and its operation in scientific knowledge projects, yet Harding does not revise the scientific method or produce an alternative approach to knowledge projects. Standpoint epistemologists provide a short solution: to “start from marginalized lives” and “take everyday life as problematic”, but even this epistemological approach limits the disenfranchised person to their experiences thereby reintroducing direct political and personal biases into knowledge projects. No longer does rationality and logical thinking play as important a role in producing knowledge, but Harding elevates the individual’s experience as veridical which is as controversial as an opinion. How can you reject my analysis of a given circumstance if I have carefully evaluated the problems and produced my conclusion? 
	Harding argues that some socially situated knowledge is more applicable in certain fields of study than are others. She avoids the dooming relativists’ argument by claiming that neither do all social situations provide equally strong resources for understanding the world nor do they equally limit knowledge. She coins “strong objectivity”, defining it as equalizing the critical, causal relationships between the researching subject and the resulting object. This approach to a value-neutral account necessitates collaboration of contradicting experiences and beliefs to gain a larger, objective understanding, but the knowledge of a “strong objectivity” account relies on (almost) complete cultural acceptance of particular beliefs. How can a social situated belief become knowledge, according to strong objectivity, if the individual subjects’ characteristics are as critical to the objectivity as the object? Also, who will accept a new proposition as strong objectivity when their social situation has little significance to the problem in question? Harding says belief becomes knowledge when agreed upon by the whole community, but the incontestable differences in a community should deny certain beliefs while approving others. 
	How can we reconcile this disagreement about which social situated knowledge is valid and which is not? Lastly, when social situated knowledge is passed down through education etc., does the relayer of this knowledge do so objectively, in accordance with the objective knowledge agreed upon? I would argue that there is a lot of room for error in teaching and educating, in regard to relaying perfect objectivity as it was established. Would linguistic and rhetorical errors detract from the strong objectivity of knowledge, or does this objectivity change as society changes?",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,Feminist Objectivity: On Standpoint Epistemology &amp; Social Situated Knowledge,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/7huptq/feminist_objectivity_on_standpoint_epistemology/

I'll think I've had a small victory in correcting a male friend's inadvertent sexism to then go and get catcalled 3 times on the way home. 

Since I started becoming more educated on sexual harassment (and sexism in general) IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE IT. 
It's everywhere, it's every day: walking anywhere, at work, at uni, at clubs, in sports, at home, from males AND females. 

I am glad I notice things I wouldn't if I wasn't somewhat educated on the subject. I like to think I can make a difference, however small. 
It's just hard to pick my battles and know when to give up.

Personally I have had a physical preference of attraction to traits of individual women not a template. Honestly every woman has something that sets her apart. Only personality can really be ugly. In addition I always compliment the one whom gives cues of having physical issues. No it’s not to wrestle one up, just a nice creep “excuse madam I apologize the intrusion but I just simply had to let you know that X thing is (insert descriptive word). I hope you have a wonderful night” quick not aggressive and immediately leave. The point is a compliment not a cast. My signature “creep” move is buying a sad looking woman on the bar a drink with the strict instructions of not being told whom it’s from. The point is a drink not a device to converse, no you don’t circle back either. Now I am nowhere near a mutated chromosome avenger of Pandora. Far from it. I just treat woman the way I still treat my matriarchal branch and how I would want my daughter to be treated. Bottom line I love the all women campaign, agree totes.


Now here is where I will be hind and quartered. I believe that men should also be treated in similar fashion. Yes men are humiliated and degraded for things like being of a certain color, weight, height, and always shape. Incel hate boards are filled with change your person suggestions ect. The misandrist use this as fuel to perpetuate the belief that this is to assert the male privilege that all woman must accept men no matter what. Let me be clear as the glass ceiling (it’s not a jab I really do like glass ceilings) nowhere is it made a demand that woman sleep with men regardless, regardless what the Misandrist in the sheets Misogynist in the tweets straw man or idiot spouts. I believe that men whom have should also be treated or at least encouraged to believe that they are worth more than what’s on the outside. 

So question, why? I’m really curious. Aside from any polarization, I mean really, why would it be wrong to say we all are beautiful? As much as I want my daughter to be free from conditioning, I want my son to also be able to be free from conformity. Please all answers are welcome. 

With the all brou haha in my state planned the next few days I really want to get perspective on certain issues.

My neighbor (on a 10-hour flight) saw me reading some articles about sexual assault and decided that survivors  ""lie for attention."" She went on to tell me that she herself is a supporter of women's rights, but she hates being labeled a feminist because all the women who publicly state they are feminists post about sexual assault and misogyny but ""they are all the same women who liked the attention and were bitchy and easy"" in high school/university so ""why would we believe them now"". She is now a university professor and says she has noticed the same pattern with her students. 

She also has a son in trade school and feels that men actually have it tougher than women because now they are all being accused of assault, and ""none of them asked to be born men"". She went on to explain that men have the burden of providing for families and have to ""grow up in a world that hates them"", which causes extreme amounts of stress so they may ""act out a little"". 

The conversation did end up leading to her views on Muslim women (spoiler: we are all oppressed or acting out from our oppression by denying it), and Trump, who she says, she didn't vote for (she didn't vote at all because she wasn't ""impressed"" with the candidates) but we haven't given ""enough of a chance"" to him. 

What was most interesting to me was that throughout our conversation she kept referencing how she is a mother, a university professor, and older than me, which (she felt) gave her views greater legitimacy. 

The last thing I asked her was what, then, did she think we needed to do to attain women's rights? Her response? ""Slow down, your generation is too entitled.""

He was 16, we got along very well and exchanged our Facebook information. A little while later he started to flirt with me and mentioned masturbating in front of me which i declined but he did it anyway. I, being the innocent child i was, knew nothing about sex nor male masturbation was too shocked to disconnect and watched. 
A few days later I realized what has happened and felt really gross and ashamed so I messaged his father and told him to “talk with his son about nude chatting” haven’t heard anything ever since. 
Then an hour ago my girlfriend and I talked casually and I opened up to her and talked her about what happened (she was the first person I told her about the incident). 
She got kinda aggressive, kept telling me I overreacted, that it was not my business etc. When I said that it a huge impact on me she started to say things like „you could have just disconnected„ or „oh come on it’s not like you were abused or anything„ and protected “the poor guy”
I was really shocked about her attitude and her total lack of support so I just left and now of course she is mad and I am too. 
Now I’m wondering did I overreact back then or was my reaction appropriate? 
Is she right? 

TL;DR: a guy masturbated in front of me when I was a child so I contacted his parents about this. Years later I told my gf who said it wasn’t my business and pretended like I’m the one who did something wrong and protected the guy. Now she is mad at me ",False,Feminism,t5_2qr7i,self,A guy masturbated I front of me (20F) when I was a kid so i told his parents.

First, I am a man. I understand this limits my ability to view things from the female perspective. That’s a big part of the reason I’m coming to a feminist subreddit to get opinions on this topic. Second, I’ve discussed this topic with my girlfriend and done some research on my own. What I’m mostly looking for here is broader feedback on her perspective and what I’ve read online.

**Background**

Since this is a strange topic I want to make it known that I’m not some kind of pervert who just wants to see vaginas in film/TV. If that were my motivation I’d just go watch porn. My interest in this topic is sociological: what does this say about gender relations in the US?

I had never really thought about this topic before a few months ago when Wonder Woman came out. My girlfriend and I both saw the film and really enjoyed it. In particular we discussed how wonderful it was to have a strong female lead in an action movie with a female director. It broke some molds for a blockbuster and was a win for equality of the sexes.

I told her that I would like be able to take my daughter to see it (age 9, from a previous relationship), because of these strong feminist themes, but that I was concerned she was too young for some of the sexual content. In particular, the Chris Pine nude scene but also the discussions about whether men are necessary for pleasure.

She took this is as a criticism of the inclusion of the Chris Pine nude scene (not my intent) and ended up sending me an article talking about how the inclusion of that scene was a win for feminism since action movies typically have “the male gaze” and include unnecessary sex appeal targeted to men. Having Wonder Women fully clothed while a man is helplessly naked in front of her was supposed to be “a reversal.” I responded that since true feminism is about equality and includes advocacy for men’s issues, we shouldn’t consider “pay back” to be a good motive.

This lead to a broader **friendly** discussion about the imbalance of male/female nudity. Neither of us are jealous, we’re just both interested in sociology. It went something like this:

**Her:** Women are shown “nude” more frequently.

**Me:** Breasts are shown more frequently than full male nudity, but men are shown shirtless as often or more often and this is often for sexual appeal.

**Her:** But men being shirtless isn’t considered nudity. Only a penis counts as nudity.

**Me:** Movies do show penises on occasion, but never vaginas (I’ll clarify what I mean by this later.) More importantly, I thought desexualizing breasts was a goal of feminism? (Aka free the nipple)

When Thor: Ragnarok came out I rekindled the discussion by sending her [this article ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com/amphtml/entertainment/director-taika-waititi-added-gratuitous-shirtless-chris-hemsworth-scene-thor-ragnarok-put-bums-seats-184953728.html) (or one like it) where Chris Hemsworth says he thought his shirtless scene was “unnecessary” and “gratuitous” and that it wasn’t originally in the script. He was forced to do the scene by his director for sex appeal. She agreed with me that if a female actor was forced to do unscripted nudity for “sex appeal” to men, that it would be considered sexual harassment and probably lead to a media blow up.

The only point of disagreement we still have really is on the disparate treatment of genitalia in film/TV.

**Research**

The MPAA has strict rules regarding showing genitalia in film. Breaking these rules takes you from “R” to “NC17” and shrinks your potential audience. Penises can be shown, but not fully erect. If they flop, they can only flop side to side and not up or down (looks too much like an erection.) Vaginas on the other hand, usually can’t be shown at all (meaning no labia minor, labia major, or even vulva “cleft.”) If a woman does “full frontal nudity” she usually has to have either a naturally thick bush or wear a “merkin” which covers her actual parts.

&gt; The MPAA will allow a penis up close, for an extended period, in good lighting, and now semi-erect, (Hall Pass / Bruno) whereas the vulva, labia, clitoris, or vagina have been shown a grand total of ZERO times (unless you want to count the ""did I see what I thought I just saw"" moment of Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct or Rosario Dawson in Trance). If a female's pubic region is clean shaven she will be required to wear a merkin (pu**y wig) so as not to show any vulva cleft and get the dreaded NC-17.

[Source](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-movies-allowed-to-show-a-penis-but-not-a-vagina)

There are a few very minor exceptions to this. “Trance” drew some criticism for showing a fully nude Rosario Dawson with a shaved pubic region. This had a very specific purpose in the story, so maybe that’s why it escaped the NC17 rating (there were still no labia shown, but it was a bald pubic area showing the cleft, which is extremely rare.)

However, despite the calls for “more penis” in shows like Game of Thrones or movies and TV in general—and despite praise for shows like American Gods for [showing a lot of dong](https://www.google.com/amp/s/themuse.jezebel.com/so-far-american-gods-has-shown-more-dick-than-all-of-t-1793867555/amp)—male genitalia are not black listed in the same way.

The more I read about this the more I thought my original conception of the problem may have been backwards. I was thinking the imbalance was sexist against men, but it’s really sexist against women. Vaginas are seen as more “pornographic” than penises because of outdated concepts about female purity. Male actors who go nude are called “bold” and “brave” while female actors risk slut shaming.

&gt; I asked someone who knows a lot about vaginas, Emma Rees, author of The Vagina: A Literary and Cultural History, why films felt more comfortable depicting one genitalia over the other. Turns out, vaginas are pretty radical. ""When a woman is doing her own thing with her own body, the action has an impact far beyond the immediate act: It becomes symbolic of an independence and self-governance that is threatening precisely because it excludes the penis,"" she said. ""The response to this, literally for millennia, has been ridicule, rage, or violence.""

&gt; Namely, it was the autonomy of the vagina from being arousing to men that reconfigured it as something radical or taboo. ""One of the most interesting things I learned while writing was just how illogically squeamish people are about vaginas, vulvas, labia, and so on,"" Rees continued. ""This was especially apparent in the complaints people made at an artist's exhibition which showed beautiful images of crowning [the moment the baby's head first appears during vaginal childbirth]. The revulsion some people articulated was hypocritical in many cases—the same people saying, 'Urgh! A vagina!' were probably only two mouse-clicks away from accessing porn and saying, 'Ooh! A vagina!' Some people get very anxious when the vagina is not being represented for their pleasure; they feel excluded by its power and autonomy.""

**Questions**

Do you think we need more vaginas in film/TV as an expression of female power?

Do you think there should be more penises in TV/film?

Do you think “paying back” generations of gratuitous female nudity with unnecessary male nudity or partial nudity is a good strategy for feminists who believe in equality?

**TLDR**

Discussions with my girlfriend about imbalance of male/female nudity in film lead us to discover that while women have been shown more frequently partially nude, female genitalia is almost entirely banned from TV/film while male genitalia is freely shown.

And perhaps the sexes are more closely related than we think, and the great renewal of the world will perhaps consist in man and woman, freed of all sense of error and disappointment, seeking one another out not as opposites but as brothers and sisters and neighbours, and they will join together as *human beings*, to share the heavy weight of sexuality that is laid upon them with simplicity, gravity and patience. 


""We are only now just coming to the point where we can consider the relationship of one human individual to another objectively and without prejudice, and our attempts to live such a relation have no model to go on. And yet in the shifting of the times there are already a few things that can help our tentative beginnings. Girls and women, in their new, particular unfolding, wil only in passing imitate men's behaviour and misbehaviour and follow in male professions. Once the uncertainty of such transitions is over it will emerge that women have only passed through the spectrum and the variety of those (often laughable) disguises in order to purify their truest natures from the distorting influences of the other sex. (...) Man (...) in his ignorance and impatience, undervalues what he thinks he loves. This humanity which inhabits woman, brought to term in pain and humiliation, will, once she has shrugged off the conventions of mere femininity through the transformations of her outward status, come clearly to light, and men, who today do not yet feel it approaching, will be taken by surprise and struck down by it. One day (there are already reliable signs which speak for it and which begin to spread their light, especially in the northern countries), one there will be girls and women whose name will no longer just signify the opposite of the male but something in their own right, something which does not make one thing of any supplement or limit but only of life and existence: the female human being. 

This step forward (at first right against the will of the men who are left behind) will transform the experience of love, which is now full of error, alter it root and branch, reshape it into a relation between two human being and no longer between man an d woman. And this more human form of love (which will be performed in infinitely gentle and considerate fashion, true and clear in its creating of bonds and dissolving of them) will resemble the one we are struggling and toiling to prepare the way for, the love that consists in two solitudes protecting, defining and welcoming one another.

I'm going to be doing my own research, but I thought starting this thread would kick things off anyways, and I'm sure there must be a few lurkers here dying to share and help me out.

I am interested in the parallels between the existence of corruption in elite powers (political, economical, and private equity) and the degree of patriarchal systems in those societies. I just came to the conclusion that possibly the best way to control the elites is through creating strong cultural values that seep into the minds of elites' descendants as well as force a degree of conforming when they cannot hold certain conspiracies (as in back-room agreements) from public view.

Then I realized that feminists are fighting for their own rights at the same time people who care about general well being are fighting to remove sick, corrupt people from power. To what degree these people are on the same side, I'm not sure, but looking back at the history of man's dominance in society might enlighten a little. Not that history is always the best guide; there are plenty of places in the world today who are thriving and have different political structures than they used to. [Here's a list of the top ten least-corrupt countries in the world](https://themysteriousworld.com/10-least-corrupt-countries-in-the-world/).

I don't mean feminism in general, I mean the website everydayfeminism.com. Before you think I am a white man, I am not. I am white, Jewish, female, who had learning disabilities and was in special ed and is mentally ill

**1. The concept of allyship.** At first the concept of being an ally may seem like a great idea. But it isn't. An ally is a term given by the ""oppressed"" group to someone privileged when they trust them. Jamie Utt wrote an article [10 Ways Men Can Combat Sexist Entitlement in Public]( https://everydayfeminism.com/2014/07/combat-entitlement-in-public/). I disagree with this article completely, but some women will label him an ally. He's not an ally to woman, he's only an ally to women who agree with his article.

Women are not a monolith. They make up half the worlds population, so how can you be an ally to every single one?

I can see the concept of allyship working in certain times, such as Danish people or people who rescued Jews were allies to Jews during the holocaust. But it doesn't work today. Everyday feminism recently wrote an article about resisting antisemitism. As a white Jew I have never been discriminated against for being Jewish. My dad who is from the Soviet Union and was discriminated there said Jews aren't discriminated here. I have never been stopped by the police, denied service due to being Jewish or been redlined. Yet someone commented ""we desperately need non-Jewish allies"". Allies to whom? If one Jew or a group of Jews labels someone an ally, are they also an ally merely because I am an Ashkenazi. No. 

**2. The term stupid is not ableist.** While I have never been discriminated for being Jewish or a woman, I have been discriminated by being placed in a special ed class. When Carly Fleischmann was 13, she told her parents her therapists make her feel stupid by asking her to spell ""chips"" for a chip or asking her to spell her name. Yes disability discrimination does exist, but the words *stupid, insane, dumb* are not ableist. The problem is Everyday Feminism decided those words were ableist based on a few SJWs. They didn't even survey the majority of disabled people other than SJWs.

Instead they should address real discrimination against disabled people, such as saying ""everyone is a little OCD"", the fact that children are segregated in special ed classrooms, or are made to learn the ""life skills"" curriculum when they can and are able to do the academic curriculum.

**3. Some articles are stupid.** OK, Everyday Feminism has a lot of great articles, such as how to support people with depression, endo and other conditions, racism and other oppressions, etc. There is an article called [Can Asian-Americans Appropriate Their Own Culture?](https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/11/asian-american-appropriation/). They are basically saying Asian people can appropriate their own culture if they wear a bindi without realizing it's significance. What? Next they will say Irish Americans are appropriating St. Patrick's Day because they live in America, never been to Ireland and think it's all about leprechauns. Or black people from or whose parents are from Africa can't say the n-word because their families weren't slaves and perhaps their ancestors sold other black people to slaves. Then they had an article called [Sociopaths, Borderlines, and Psychotics: 3 Mental Illnesses We Must Stop Hating On]( https://everydayfeminism.com/2016/04/mental-illnesses-stop-hating-on/). Just by reading the title you can guess what the article is about.

I am to this day having huge difficulties declaring myself a feminist due to something that happened a while ago.

I used to do photography as a hobby and decided to go professional. One of the girls I photographed and became friends with set her eyes on my boyfriend at the time. She was an outspoken feminist and had a blog sharing articles and arguments for feminism. 

 When my then boyfriend broke up with me I suspected the reason may have been another girl, maybe even her since I accidentally saw a facebook message she sent him but he never admitted to this.

Some time later I found out how they saw each other behind my back for 6 months before our break up and how she manipulated and pushed him into leaving me. 

Every time I look at HeforShe Vienna posts and see her, I feel like throwing up. I have showed her only friendship and positivity and all I got in return was someone who only did harm out of pure selfishness (she left him later anyway).


I know we are fighting for equality between genders, but when will the topic become equality between each other as women? This frustrates me to no end and I now feel as though I have to be ""on guard"" every time I bring friends around my partner.


How do you feel about this and has this ever happened to you ?
